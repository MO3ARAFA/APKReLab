- M5 Insecure Communication: 1
- M10 Insufficient Cryptography: 1

### Findings

#### 1. [MEDIUM] Backup allowed (allowBackup)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-530 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-allow-backup
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: android:allowBackup is not explicitly "false" (it defaults to true). Via `adb backup` (no root needed on many OS versions) or a cloud backup, the app's private data - databases, SharedPreferences, saved tokens - can be extracted.
- Risk scenario: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.
- Fix: Set android:allowBackup="false", or if backups are wanted, add a dataExtractionRules/fullBackupContent file that explicitly excludes anything sensitive.

#### 2. [LOW] No network security config referenced

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: manifest-network-security-config
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: No android:networkSecurityConfig is set. On devices running API < 28, cleartext HTTP is allowed by default unless a config says otherwise, so this app's real cleartext posture on older phones is unverified here.
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Add a network_security_config.xml with cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" as the base config (and certificate pinning if the app always talks to the same backend).

#### 3. [MEDIUM] Exported activity without a permission: protect.card_locker.cardview.LoyaltyCardViewActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 4. [LOW] Exported activity without a permission: protect.card_locker.LoyaltyCardEditActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered to LOW: exported by design (public entry action: VIEW).
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 5. [LOW] Exported activity without a permission: protect.card_locker.ImportExportActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered to LOW: exported by design (public entry action: VIEW).
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 6. [MEDIUM] Exported activity without a permission: protect.card_locker.CardShortcutConfigure

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 7. [MEDIUM] Exported provider protects only reads: protect.card_locker.contentprovider.CardsContentProvider

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-provider-partial-permission
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This exported provider declares android:readPermission but no writePermission, so any app can insert / update / delete its data.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Declare both readPermission and writePermission (signature level if only your own apps need it), or use android:permission for both.

#### 8. [MEDIUM] Sensitive value saved to SharedPreferences (plaintext)

- Location: `protect.card_locker.shared.WearBluetoothSecurity`
- CWE: CWE-312 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: androgoat-checks
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: putString() is called next to a credential-like name. SharedPreferences are stored as plain XML in the app's data directory; they are readable on rooted devices and in backups when allowBackup is on.  (around line 519)
- Risk scenario: Anyone with the device in hand, a backup, a rooted phone or another app exploiting a file leak can read tokens, passwords or personal data stored in plain text.
- Fix: Do not store passwords/tokens in SharedPreferences. Use EncryptedSharedPreferences or the Android Keystore, and prefer short-lived tokens.

#### 9. [HIGH] Untrusted input reaches an SQL statement

- Location: `protect.card_locker.contentprovider.CardsContentProvider`
- CWE: CWE-89 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: taint-flow
- Priority: 60/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Data from a ContentProvider method parameter (other apps can call it when the provider is exported) reaches SQLiteDatabase.query() in method query(): table, selection, GROUP BY, HAVING or ORDER BY contains the input (only selectionArgs are bound safely). The value was followed through registers, fields and calls inside this class and no sanitizer was seen on the way.  (around line 529)
- Risk scenario: Input such as ' OR '1'='1 changes the meaning of the query: an attacker (or another app calling an exported ContentProvider) can read other rows, bypass a login check or modify data.
- Fix: Use selection arguments (?) or Room parameters for every value; never concatenate input into SQL. Allow-list table, column and ORDER BY names.

#### 10. [LOW] Weak hash: SHA-1

- Location: `protect.card_locker.Utils`
- CWE: CWE-328 | OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: crypto-weak-hash
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: SHA-1 is deprecated for security use (collision attacks exist); not safe for certificates or signatures.  (around line 320)
- Risk scenario: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.
- Fix: Use SHA-256 or better.

#### 11. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `protect.card_locker.cardview.LoyaltyCardViewActivity`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 354)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 12. [LOW] PendingIntent without FLAG_IMMUTABLE

- Location: `protect.card_locker.ListWidget`
- CWE: CWE-927 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: pendingintent-mutable
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A mutable PendingIntent can be filled in by another app that receives it (changing action/extras), and Android 12+ requires you to choose explicitly.  (around line 527)
- Risk scenario: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.
- Fix: Add PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE unless the receiver truly needs to modify it.

#### 13. [LOW] Temp file created

- Location: `com.yalantis.ucrop.util.ImageHeaderParser`
- CWE: CWE-377 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app creates a temp file. If sensitive content is written and the file is not deleted (or sits in a shared directory) other code can read it.  (around line 500)
- Risk scenario: A predictable temp file in a shared folder can be pre-created or replaced by another app.
- Fix: Write temp data under the app's private cacheDir, delete it as soon as it is used, and never put secrets in it unencrypted.

#### 14. [MEDIUM] FileProvider shares too much (<cache-path path="/">, <files-path path="/">)

- Location: `res/7Y.xml`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: LOW | Rule: res-fileprovider-paths
- Priority: 27/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: These FileProvider paths cover a whole directory tree (the root of the file system or the app's private data: databases, shared_prefs, tokens). Any content:// URI the app hands out, or lets a caller choose, can then point at files that were never meant to be shared.  [res/7Y.xml]
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: List only the specific sub-folder to share (for example path="shared/"), never root-path or path=".", and keep the provider exported="false" with grantUriPermissions="true".

#### 15. [LOW] Keyboard cache: sensitive input field

- Location: `res/66.xml`
- CWE: CWE-524 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The field "(id not resolved)" looks sensitive or is the main input of this screen, but its inputType (not set) does not disable suggestions. The keyboard may learn and cache what is typed (autocorrect dictionary, predictive text).  [res/66.xml]
- Risk scenario: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.
- Fix: Use android:inputType="textPassword" (or textNoSuggestions|textVisiblePassword) and consider importantForAutofill="no" for secrets.

#### 16. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input chooses the file or content URI the app opens

- Location: `protect.card_locker.LoyaltyCardEditActivity`
- CWE: CWE-73 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: taint-flow
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getData() reaches ContentResolver.openInputStream() in method LoyaltyCardEditActivity.startCropperUri(Landroid/net/Uri;)V. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value travels through 2 methods. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field. No exported component reaches this method in the call graph: it may be internal-only, or reached through an implicit Intent, reflection or a lambda the graph does not follow. 2 flows of this kind end in this method.
- Risk scenario: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.
- Fix: Accept only the content:// authorities you expect (reject file:// and your own FileProvider/app-private paths) before opening a URI that came from an Intent; copy with a fixed name and cap the size.

#### 17. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input chooses the file or content URI the app opens

- Location: `protect.card_locker.PkpassParser`
- CWE: CWE-73 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: taint-flow
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getData() reaches ContentResolver.openInputStream() in method PkpassParser.<init>(Landroid/content/Context;Landroid/net/Uri;)V. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value travels through 3 methods. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field. No exported component reaches this method in the call graph: it may be internal-only, or reached through an implicit Intent, reflection or a lambda the graph does not follow. The same input, read in ScanActivity$handleActivityResult$1.invokeSuspend(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;, also reaches this kind of API in: Utils.retrieveBarcodesFromPdf(Landroid/content/Context;Landroid/net/Uri;)Ljava/util/ArrayList; (one root cause, one card).
- Risk scenario: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.
- Fix: Accept only the content:// authorities you expect (reject file:// and your own FileProvider/app-private paths) before opening a URI that came from an Intent; copy with a fixed name and cap the size.

### Remediation guide

One entry per weakness type found above.

#### CWE-530 - Exposure of Backup File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="false" android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules" ...>
<!-- or keep backup and exclude secrets with fullBackupContent / dataExtractionRules -->
```

#### CWE-319 - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" ...>
val url = "http://api.example.com/login"   // plain HTTP
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true" />   <!-- every domain may use plain HTTP -->
</network-security-config>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="false" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" ...>
val url = "https://api.example.com/login"   // TLS
<!-- res/xml/network_security_config.xml -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" />
</network-security-config>
<!-- only if one legacy host really needs HTTP: scope it to that host, never to base-config -->
<domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
    <domain includeSubdomains="false">legacy.example.com</domain>
</domain-config>
```

#### CWE-926 - Improper Export of Android Application Components

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="true" />
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="normal" />   <!-- any app can request it -->
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" />   <!-- writes are open -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="false" />
<!-- if another app must call it: android:permission="com.example.PERM" with protectionLevel="signature", and validate every extra -->
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="signature" />
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" android:writePermission="com.example.WRITE" />
```

#### CWE-312 - Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: Anyone with the device in hand, a backup, a rooted phone or another app exploiting a file leak can read tokens, passwords or personal data stored in plain text.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
prefs.edit().putString("password", password).apply()
db.execSQL("INSERT INTO users(pin) VALUES ('" + pin + "')")
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// store a token (not the password) and encrypt it with a Keystore-backed AES-GCM key
val sealed = keystoreCipher.encrypt(token.toByteArray())     // see CWE-321 sample for the key
prefs.edit().putString("token", Base64.encodeToString(sealed, Base64.NO_WRAP)).apply()
// database: SQLCipher or per-field encryption; never keep the password itself
```

#### CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (SQL Injection)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-CODE

Risk: Input such as ' OR '1'='1 changes the meaning of the query: an attacker (or another app calling an exported ContentProvider) can read other rows, bypass a login check or modify data.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + name + "'", null)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?", arrayOf(name))   // bound parameter
// ContentProvider.query: pass selection with ? and selectionArgs, never concatenate them
```

#### CWE-328 - Use of Weak Hash

OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO

Risk: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-1").digest(data)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256").digest(data)
// passwords: use a slow KDF (PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 with 600000+ iterations, Argon2id, scrypt)
```

#### CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = true
<provider android:exported="true" android:grantUriPermissions="true" ... />   <!-- every path can be handed out -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = false
webSettings.allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs = false
<provider android:exported="false" android:grantUriPermissions="false" ...>
    <grant-uri-permission android:pathPrefix="/shared/" />   <!-- only the paths that must be shared -->
</provider>
```

#### CWE-927 - Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.example.TOKEN").putExtra("token", t))
PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, 0)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.example.TOKEN").setPackage(packageName).putExtra("token", t))
PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE)
```

#### CWE-377 - Insecure Temporary File

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A predictable temp file in a shared folder can be pre-created or replaced by another app.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
File("/sdcard/tmp_" + id)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
File.createTempFile("tmp_", ".bin", cacheDir)   // app-private cache
```

#### CWE-524 - Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="text" />   <!-- password-like field with suggestions on -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin

#### CWE-73 - External Control of File Name or Path

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri"); contentResolver.openInputStream(uri!!)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri")
if (uri?.scheme == "content" && uri.authority in ALLOWED_AUTHORITIES) contentResolver.openInputStream(uri)
```
