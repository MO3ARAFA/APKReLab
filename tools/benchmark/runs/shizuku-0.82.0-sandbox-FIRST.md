# APK ReLab report: moe.shizuku.privileged.api

(sandbox scan, no AI triage)

## Security scan

Heuristic static scan - 35 finding(s) in total; 19 listed below (app/unknown code; INFO and known-library findings left out). Findings are leads: verify manually before relying on any of this.

Not covered by this scan: business-logic flaws (prices, limits, order flows), server-side bugs of the APIs the app calls, and native (C/C++) code; a large app is analysed in groups, so a data flow that crosses groups can be missed.

### Findings

#### 1. [MEDIUM] Backup allowed (allowBackup)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-530 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-allow-backup
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: android:allowBackup is not explicitly "false" (it defaults to true). Via `adb backup` (no root needed on many OS versions) or a cloud backup, the app's private data - databases, SharedPreferences, saved tokens - can be extracted.
- Risk scenario: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.
- Fix: Set android:allowBackup="false", or if backups are wanted, add a dataExtractionRules/fullBackupContent file that explicitly excludes anything sensitive.

#### 2. [LOW] No network security config referenced

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: manifest-network-security-config
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: No android:networkSecurityConfig is set. On devices running API < 28, cleartext HTTP is allowed by default unless a config says otherwise, so this app's real cleartext posture on older phones is unverified here.
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Add a network_security_config.xml with cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" as the base config (and certificate pinning if the app always talks to the same backend).

#### 3. [MEDIUM] Exported activity without a permission: moe.shizuku.manager.legacy.ShellRequestHandlerActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 4. [MEDIUM] Exported receiver without a permission: moe.shizuku.manager.receiver.ShizukuReceiver

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This receiver is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 5. [MEDIUM] Powerful permissions requested (1)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-250 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-powerful-permissions
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: - WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS: changes secure system settings
- Risk scenario: Extra privileges (debuggable, test-only, shared user id, legacy storage) widen what a compromise or a malicious app can reach. Powerful permissions (SMS, overlay, install packages) and an AccessibilityService give a compromised app, or overlay and banking malware, far more reach than the feature needs.
- Fix: Request only what the feature really needs, and prefer the narrower alternative (photo picker, SAF, SMS Retriever / User Consent API instead of READ_SMS).

#### 6. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `rikka.shizuku.Oo`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 188)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 7. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `rikka.shizuku.Nj`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/properties/scanner) and 13 more in this class. Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 1745)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 8. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `rikka.shizuku.dk`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 152)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 9. [MEDIUM] Dynamic code loading

- Location: `rikka.shizuku.se`
- CWE: CWE-94 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: dynamic-code-loading
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: The app loads code at runtime (DexClassLoader & co). If the dex/jar comes from a writable or downloaded location without integrity checks, an attacker can swap it and run code with the app's permissions.  (around line 107)
- Risk scenario: Code loaded at runtime from a writable, downloaded or attacker-reachable location executes with the app's permissions, so replacing that file means running the attacker's code.
- Fix: Load code only from app-private, read-only storage, verify a signature/hash, or bundle it in the APK.

#### 10. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `rikka.shizuku.xh`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 1596)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 11. [MEDIUM] Shell command execution

- Location: `rikka.shizuku.q5`
- CWE: CWE-78 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: shell-exec
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: The app runs an OS command via Runtime.exec/ProcessBuilder. If any part of that command comes from user input, an Intent extra, or a server response, this is a command-injection surface.  (around line 88)
- Risk scenario: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).
- Fix: Trace where the command string comes from; avoid building it from untrusted input, or use a fixed allow-list of arguments instead of a shell string.

#### 12. [MEDIUM] Shell command execution

- Location: `rikka.shizuku.Wr`
- CWE: CWE-78 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: shell-exec
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: The app runs an OS command via Runtime.exec/ProcessBuilder. If any part of that command comes from user input, an Intent extra, or a server response, this is a command-injection surface.  (around line 538)
- Risk scenario: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).
- Fix: Trace where the command string comes from; avoid building it from untrusted input, or use a fixed allow-list of arguments instead of a shell string.

#### 13. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `rikka.shizuku.F2`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 281)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 14. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `rikka.shizuku.sr`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/features/ignore-bogons) and 8 more in this class. Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 4733)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 15. [MEDIUM] Shell command execution

- Location: `rikka.shizuku.an`
- CWE: CWE-78 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: shell-exec
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: The app runs an OS command via Runtime.exec/ProcessBuilder. If any part of that command comes from user input, an Intent extra, or a server response, this is a command-injection surface.  (around line 3421)
- Risk scenario: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).
- Fix: Trace where the command string comes from; avoid building it from untrusted input, or use a fixed allow-list of arguments instead of a shell string.

#### 16. [LOW] Native libraries not analysed (3 .so)

- Location: `lib/`
- Confidence: HIGH | Rule: native-coverage
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: This APK contains native libraries (libadb.so, librish.so, libshizuku.so). APKReLab analyses Java / Kotlin (dex) code only: data handed to native methods is not followed.
- Fix: Review the native code separately (e.g. strings / imports of the .so, a disassembler) and check what the app passes to its JNI methods.

#### 17. [LOW] Keyboard cache: sensitive input field (x2)

- Location: `res/66.xml`
- CWE: CWE-524 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The field "(id not resolved)" looks sensitive or is the main input of this screen, but its inputType (not set) does not disable suggestions. The keyboard may learn and cache what is typed (autocorrect dictionary, predictive text).  [res/66.xml]  The same applies to 1 more layout(s): res/S6.xml.
- Risk scenario: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.
- Fix: Use android:inputType="textPassword" (or textNoSuggestions|textVisiblePassword) and consider importantForAutofill="no" for secrets.

#### 18. [HIGH] Untrusted input selects a class or method by name

- Location: `rikka.shizuku.Kc`
- CWE: CWE-470 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: taint-flow
- Priority: 60/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Data from Parcel.readString() (through field Wc.a:Ljava/lang/String; (written in Wc.<init>(Landroid/os/Parcel;)V)) reaches Class.forName() in method Kc.b(Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Class;. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value travels through 4 methods. The value is read from a Parcel inside an unmarshalling method (a Parcelable constructor, createFromParcel, readFromParcel or a Binder onTransact). The Parcel is filled by another app when the object is received through an Intent extra or an exported service: check where this class is read from an Intent or Binder call.
- Risk scenario: A class or method name coming from outside lets the attacker pick which code runs.
- Fix: Look the name up in an explicit allow-list (a map of known keys to classes) instead of passing it to Class.forName / getMethod.

#### 19. [HIGH] Untrusted input selects a class or method by name

- Location: `rikka.shizuku.Tk`
- CWE: CWE-470 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: taint-flow
- Priority: 60/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Data from Parcel.createStringArrayList() (through R2.g(Ljava/lang/String;)Landroid/os/Bundle;) reaches Class.forName() in method Tk.a(Lrikka/shizuku/xg;Lrikka/shizuku/rg;)V. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value is read from a Parcel inside an unmarshalling method (a Parcelable constructor, createFromParcel, readFromParcel or a Binder onTransact). The Parcel is filled by another app when the object is received through an Intent extra or an exported service: check where this class is read from an Intent or Binder call.
- Risk scenario: A class or method name coming from outside lets the attacker pick which code runs.
- Fix: Look the name up in an explicit allow-list (a map of known keys to classes) instead of passing it to Class.forName / getMethod.

### Remediation guide

One entry per weakness type found above.

#### CWE-530 - Exposure of Backup File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="false" android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules" ...>
<!-- or keep backup and exclude secrets with fullBackupContent / dataExtractionRules -->
```

#### CWE-319 - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" ...>
val url = "http://api.example.com/login"   // plain HTTP
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true" />   <!-- every domain may use plain HTTP -->
</network-security-config>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="false" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" ...>
val url = "https://api.example.com/login"   // TLS
<!-- res/xml/network_security_config.xml -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" />
</network-security-config>
<!-- only if one legacy host really needs HTTP: scope it to that host, never to base-config -->
<domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
    <domain includeSubdomains="false">legacy.example.com</domain>
</domain-config>
```

#### CWE-926 - Improper Export of Android Application Components

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="true" />
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="normal" />   <!-- any app can request it -->
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" />   <!-- writes are open -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="false" />
<!-- if another app must call it: android:permission="com.example.PERM" with protectionLevel="signature", and validate every extra -->
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="signature" />
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" android:writePermission="com.example.WRITE" />
```

#### CWE-250 - Execution with Unnecessary Privileges

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Extra privileges (debuggable, test-only, shared user id, legacy storage) widen what a compromise or a malicious app can reach. Powerful permissions (SMS, overlay, install packages) and an AccessibilityService give a compromised app, or overlay and banking malware, far more reach than the feature needs.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:debuggable="true" android:testOnly="true" ...>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS" />
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<!-- ship release builds without debuggable / testOnly; request only the permissions you use -->
<!-- OTP codes: SMS Retriever or SMS User Consent API instead of READ_SMS; files: photo picker or the Storage Access Framework -->
```

#### CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = true
<provider android:exported="true" android:grantUriPermissions="true" ... />   <!-- every path can be handed out -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = false
webSettings.allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs = false
<provider android:exported="false" android:grantUriPermissions="false" ...>
    <grant-uri-permission android:pathPrefix="/shared/" />   <!-- only the paths that must be shared -->
</provider>
```

#### CWE-94 - Improper Control of Generation of Code (Code Injection)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: Code loaded at runtime from a writable, downloaded or attacker-reachable location executes with the app's permissions, so replacing that file means running the attacker's code.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
DexClassLoader(File(getExternalFilesDir(null), "plugin.dex").path, optDir, null, classLoader)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// ship the code in the APK, or download it over HTTPS, verify a signature, and keep it in app-private storage (read-only after verification)
val f = File(filesDir, "plugin.dex"); verifySignature(f); f.setReadOnly()
```

#### CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("ping " + host)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// no shell: fixed program, arguments as separate list items, validated input
ProcessBuilder("ping", "-c", "1", validatedHost).redirectErrorStream(true).start()
// better: use an Android API instead of a command
```

#### CWE-524 - Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="text" />   <!-- password-like field with suggestions on -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword|textNoSuggestions" android:importantForAutofill="no" />
```

#### CWE-470 - Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code (Unsafe Reflection)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: A class or method name coming from outside lets the attacker pick which code runs.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
Class.forName(intent.getStringExtra("cls")).newInstance()
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val handlers = mapOf("a" to ::HandlerA, "b" to ::HandlerB)     // explicit allow-list
val h = handlers[intent.getStringExtra("cls")]?.invoke() ?: return
```
