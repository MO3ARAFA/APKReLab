## Security scan

Heuristic static scan - 123 finding(s) in total; 16 listed below (app/unknown code; INFO and known-library findings left out). Findings are leads: verify manually before relying on any of this.

### Summary

| Severity | Count |
|---|---|
| MEDIUM | 7 |
| LOW | 9 |

**OWASP Mobile Top 10 (2024) coverage**

- M9 Insecure Data Storage: 6
- M8 Security Misconfiguration: 3
- M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation: 3
- M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization: 2
- M5 Insecure Communication: 1
- Not mapped: 1

### Findings

#### 1. [MEDIUM] Backup allowed (allowBackup)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-530 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-allow-backup
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: android:allowBackup is not explicitly "false" (it defaults to true). Via `adb backup` (no root needed on many OS versions) or a cloud backup, the app's private data - databases, SharedPreferences, saved tokens - can be extracted.
- Risk scenario: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.
- Fix: Set android:allowBackup="false", or if backups are wanted, add a dataExtractionRules/fullBackupContent file that explicitly excludes anything sensitive.

#### 2. [LOW] No network security config referenced

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: manifest-network-security-config
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: No android:networkSecurityConfig is set. On devices running API < 28, cleartext HTTP is allowed by default unless a config says otherwise, so this app's real cleartext posture on older phones is unverified here.
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Add a network_security_config.xml with cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" as the base config (and certificate pinning if the app always talks to the same backend).

#### 3. [LOW] Deep link entry point: com.junkfood.seal.QuickDownloadActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-939 | OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: manifest-deep-links
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: This activity can be opened from a browser/other apps via http, https://. Anything in the link (path, query, fragment) is attacker-controlled input. No android:autoVerify, so the link is not verified as belonging to this app.
- Risk scenario: Any web page or app can fire the deep link. If the handler acts on its parameters (open URL, log in, pay) without checking them, the link becomes a remote control for the app.
- Fix: Validate every parameter taken from the incoming Intent data (host allow-list, type checks), never load it into a WebView or use it as a file path unchecked; for web links use verified App Links (autoVerify + assetlinks.json).

#### 4. [LOW] Deep link entry point: com.junkfood.seal.MainActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-939 | OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: manifest-deep-links
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: This activity can be opened from a browser/other apps via http, https://. Anything in the link (path, query, fragment) is attacker-controlled input. No android:autoVerify, so the link is not verified as belonging to this app.
- Risk scenario: Any web page or app can fire the deep link. If the handler acts on its parameters (open URL, log in, pay) without checking them, the link becomes a remote control for the app.
- Fix: Validate every parameter taken from the incoming Intent data (host allow-list, type checks), never load it into a WebView or use it as a file path unchecked; for web links use verified App Links (autoVerify + assetlinks.json).

#### 5. [LOW] Exported activity without a permission: com.junkfood.seal.QuickDownloadActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered to LOW: exported by design (public entry action: SEND, VIEW).
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 6. [MEDIUM] Exported activity without a permission: androidx.compose.ui.tooling.PreviewActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 7. [MEDIUM] Powerful permissions requested (2)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-250 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-powerful-permissions
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: - REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES: can install other APKs
- MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: all-files access to shared storage
- Risk scenario: Extra privileges (debuggable, test-only, shared user id, legacy storage) widen what a compromise or a malicious app can reach. Powerful permissions (SMS, overlay, install packages) and an AccessibilityService give a compromised app, or overlay and banking malware, far more reach than the feature needs.
- Fix: Request only what the feature really needs, and prefer the narrower alternative (photo picker, SAF, SMS Retriever / User Consent API instead of READ_SMS).

#### 8. [LOW] Low minSdkVersion (21)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Confidence: LOW | Rule: manifest-min-sdk
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Supporting API < 23 (Android 6) means the app can run on devices without runtime permission prompts and with older TLS/cipher defaults.
- Fix: Raise minSdkVersion if the user base allows it; otherwise double check that sensitive permissions and network calls are still handled safely on the oldest supported devices.

#### 9. [LOW] Legacy external storage requested

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-legacy-external-storage
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" opts out of scoped storage, so files the app writes to shared storage stay readable (and replaceable) by other apps that hold the storage permission.
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Migrate to scoped storage (MediaStore / SAF / getExternalFilesDir) and remove the flag.

#### 10. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `com.junkfood.seal.NotificationActionReceiver`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 163)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 11. [MEDIUM] Shell command execution

- Location: `com.yausername.youtubedl_android.YoutubeDL`
- CWE: CWE-78 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: shell-exec
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: The app runs an OS command via Runtime.exec/ProcessBuilder. If any part of that command comes from user input, an Intent extra, or a server response, this is a command-injection surface.  (around line 568)
- Risk scenario: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).
- Fix: Trace where the command string comes from; avoid building it from untrusted input, or use a fixed allow-list of arguments instead of a shell string.

#### 12. [LOW] Temp file created

- Location: `com.yausername.youtubedl_android.YoutubeDLUpdater`
- CWE: CWE-377 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app creates a temp file. If sensitive content is written and the file is not deleted (or sits in a shared directory) other code can read it.  (around line 516)
- Risk scenario: A predictable temp file in a shared folder can be pre-created or replaced by another app.
- Fix: Write temp data under the app's private cacheDir, delete it as soon as it is used, and never put secrets in it unencrypted.

#### 13. [MEDIUM] FileProvider shares too much (<external-path path=".">, <cache-path path=".">)

- Location: `res/zz.xml`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: LOW | Rule: res-fileprovider-paths
- Priority: 27/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: These FileProvider paths cover a whole directory tree (the root of the file system or the app's private data: databases, shared_prefs, tokens). Any content:// URI the app hands out, or lets a caller choose, can then point at files that were never meant to be shared.  [res/zz.xml]
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: List only the specific sub-folder to share (for example path="shared/"), never root-path or path=".", and keep the provider exported="false" with grantUriPermissions="true".

#### 14. [LOW] Keyboard cache: sensitive input field (x3)

- Location: `res/66.xml`
- CWE: CWE-524 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The field "(id not resolved)" looks sensitive or is the main input of this screen, but its inputType (not set) does not disable suggestions. The keyboard may learn and cache what is typed (autocorrect dictionary, predictive text).  [res/66.xml]  The same applies to 2 more layout(s): res/J7.xml, res/fu.xml.
- Risk scenario: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.
- Fix: Use android:inputType="textPassword" (or textNoSuggestions|textVisiblePassword) and consider importantForAutofill="no" for secrets.

#### 15. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input is used as a file path

- Location: `com.yausername.youtubedl_common.utils.ZipUtils`
- CWE: CWE-22 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW | Rule: taint-flow
- Priority: 27/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Data from ZipEntry.getName() reaches FileOutputStream.<init>() in method ZipUtils.unzip(Ljava/io/File;Ljava/io/File;)V. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value is the name of an archive entry. When the archive comes from outside the app (a download, a file another app shares) a name such as ../../x makes the extraction write outside the target folder (Zip Slip): the target path must be checked with getCanonicalPath() against the extraction folder. The chain also contains validation-like calls (startsWith, matches, getHost, canonical path, allow-list contains ...): verify that they really restrict this value before the sink. No exported component reaches this method in the call graph: it may be internal-only, or reached through an implicit Intent, reflection or a lambda the graph does not follow.
- Risk scenario: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).
- Fix: Reduce the input to a bare file name (File(name).name), resolve it against a fixed directory, call canonicalFile and check it still starts with that directory.

#### 16. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input is used as a file path

- Location: `com.yausername.youtubedl_common.utils.ZipUtils`
- CWE: CWE-22 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW | Rule: taint-flow
- Priority: 27/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Data from ZipEntry.getName() reaches FileOutputStream.<init>() in method ZipUtils.unzip(Ljava/io/InputStream;Ljava/io/File;)V. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value is the name of an archive entry. When the archive comes from outside the app (a download, a file another app shares) a name such as ../../x makes the extraction write outside the target folder (Zip Slip): the target path must be checked with getCanonicalPath() against the extraction folder.

### Remediation guide

One entry per weakness type found above.

#### CWE-530 - Exposure of Backup File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="false" android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules" ...>
<!-- or keep backup and exclude secrets with fullBackupContent / dataExtractionRules -->
```

#### CWE-319 - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" ...>
val url = "http://api.example.com/login"   // plain HTTP
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true" />   <!-- every domain may use plain HTTP -->
</network-security-config>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="false" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" ...>
val url = "https://api.example.com/login"   // TLS
<!-- res/xml/network_security_config.xml -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" />
</network-security-config>
<!-- only if one legacy host really needs HTTP: scope it to that host, never to base-config -->
<domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
    <domain includeSubdomains="false">legacy.example.com</domain>
</domain-config>
```

#### CWE-939 - Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme

OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Any web page or app can fire the deep link. If the handler acts on its parameters (open URL, log in, pay) without checking them, the link becomes a remote control for the app.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val target = intent.data?.getQueryParameter("redirect"); webView.loadUrl(target!!)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val target = intent.data?.getQueryParameter("redirect")?.let(Uri::parse)
if (target?.host == "app.example.com") open(target)     // allow-list; require user confirmation for sensitive actions
// prefer verified App Links (https + assetlinks.json) over custom schemes
```

#### CWE-926 - Improper Export of Android Application Components

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="true" />
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="normal" />   <!-- any app can request it -->
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" />   <!-- writes are open -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="false" />
<!-- if another app must call it: android:permission="com.example.PERM" with protectionLevel="signature", and validate every extra -->
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="signature" />
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" android:writePermission="com.example.WRITE" />
```

#### CWE-250 - Execution with Unnecessary Privileges

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Extra privileges (debuggable, test-only, shared user id, legacy storage) widen what a compromise or a malicious app can reach. Powerful permissions (SMS, overlay, install packages) and an AccessibilityService give a compromised app, or overlay and banking malware, far more reach than the feature needs.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:debuggable="true" android:testOnly="true" ...>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS" />
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<!-- ship release builds without debuggable / testOnly; request only the permissions you use -->
<!-- OTP codes: SMS Retriever or SMS User Consent API instead of READ_SMS; files: photo picker or the Storage Access Framework -->
```

#### CWE-922 - Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "export.json").writeText(json)
<application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
File(filesDir, "export.json").writeText(json)          // app-private storage
// to share: use a FileProvider with a narrow path and grant temporary URI permission
// scoped storage: remove requestLegacyExternalStorage; use MediaStore, the Storage Access Framework or getExternalFilesDir
```

#### CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = true
<provider android:exported="true" android:grantUriPermissions="true" ... />   <!-- every path can be handed out -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = false
webSettings.allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs = false
<provider android:exported="false" android:grantUriPermissions="false" ...>
    <grant-uri-permission android:pathPrefix="/shared/" />   <!-- only the paths that must be shared -->
</provider>
```

#### CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("ping " + host)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// no shell: fixed program, arguments as separate list items, validated input
ProcessBuilder("ping", "-c", "1", validatedHost).redirectErrorStream(true).start()
// better: use an Android API instead of a command
```

#### CWE-377 - Insecure Temporary File

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A predictable temp file in a shared folder can be pre-created or replaced by another app.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
File("/sdcard/tmp_" + id)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
File.createTempFile("tmp_", ".bin", cacheDir)   // app-private cache
```

#### CWE-524 - Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="text" />   <!-- password-like field with suggestions on -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword|textNoSuggestions" android:importantForAutofill="no" />
```

#### CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (Path Traversal)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val out = File(dir, entry.name)            // entry.name may contain ../
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val out = File(dir, entry.name).canonicalFile
