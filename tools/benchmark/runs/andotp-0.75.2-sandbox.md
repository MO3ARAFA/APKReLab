### Findings

#### 1. [MEDIUM] Backup allowed (allowBackup)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-530 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-allow-backup
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: android:allowBackup is not explicitly "false" (it defaults to true). Via `adb backup` (no root needed on many OS versions) or a cloud backup, the app's private data - databases, SharedPreferences, saved tokens - can be extracted.
- Risk scenario: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.
- Fix: Set android:allowBackup="false", or if backups are wanted, add a dataExtractionRules/fullBackupContent file that explicitly excludes anything sensitive.

#### 2. [LOW] No network security config referenced

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: manifest-network-security-config
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: No android:networkSecurityConfig is set. On devices running API < 28, cleartext HTTP is allowed by default unless a config says otherwise, so this app's real cleartext posture on older phones is unverified here.
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Add a network_security_config.xml with cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" as the base config (and certificate pinning if the app always talks to the same backend).

#### 3. [MEDIUM] Exported activity without a permission: org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Activities.PanicResponderActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 4. [MEDIUM] Exported receiver without a permission: org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Receivers.PlainTextBackupBroadcastReceiver

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This receiver is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 5. [MEDIUM] Exported receiver without a permission: org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Receivers.EncryptedBackupBroadcastReceiver

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This receiver is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 6. [LOW] Low minSdkVersion (22)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Confidence: LOW | Rule: manifest-min-sdk
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Supporting API < 23 (Android 6) means the app can run on devices without runtime permission prompts and with older TLS/cipher defaults.
- Fix: Raise minSdkVersion if the user base allows it; otherwise double check that sensitive permissions and network calls are still handled safely on the oldest supported devices.

#### 7. [LOW] Old targetSdkVersion (30)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Confidence: LOW | Rule: manifest-target-sdk
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app targets API 30, so Android keeps legacy behaviour for it, components with an intent-filter are exported by default and PendingIntents are mutable by default, and newer privacy / storage protections do not apply to it.
- Fix: Raise targetSdkVersion to a current API level and re-test; this is the cheapest way to get many OS-level protections.

#### 8. [MEDIUM] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Fragments.BaseAboutFragment`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard close to credential-like names. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 196)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 9. [MEDIUM] Weak hash: MD5

- Location: `org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Utilities.TokenCalculator`
- CWE: CWE-328 | OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: crypto-weak-hash | Scope: APP
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: MD5 is broken for integrity/signature purposes (practical collisions); fine only as a non-security checksum.  (around line 239)
- Risk scenario: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.
- Fix: Use SHA-256+ for integrity; for passwords use a salted KDF (PBKDF2/bcrypt/Argon2), never a raw hash.

#### 10. [HIGH] Weak cipher mode: ECB ("RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding") (x2)

- Location: `org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Utilities.EncryptionHelper`
- CWE: CWE-327 | OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: crypto-cipher | Scope: APP
- Priority: 70/100 (P1)
- Why flagged: Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding") uses ECB (a bare "AES"/"DES" defaults to ECB on Android): identical plaintext blocks give identical ciphertext blocks, leaking structure and allowing block swapping.  (around line 119)
- Risk scenario: DES/RC4/MD5/ECB-mode data can be decrypted or forged much faster than the key length suggests. ECB shows patterns (equal blocks give equal ciphertext) and has no integrity.
- Fix: Use AES/GCM/NoPadding with a fresh random 12-byte IV per message (or AES/CBC + HMAC if GCM is not possible).

#### 11. [MEDIUM] Predictable random value used for security

- Location: `org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Utilities.EncryptionHelper`
- CWE: CWE-338 | OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: weak-random | Scope: APP
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: The output of java.util.Random.nextInt() is returned by generateRandomIterations() of EncryptionHelper (a class that uses javax.crypto / MessageDigest). java.util.Random is a linear congruential generator: after a few outputs (or from the seed) every next value can be computed, so a token / PIN / key built from it can be guessed. Traced in SSA inside generateRandomIterations(); the receiver is a new java.util.Random (a SecureRandom held in a Random variable is not reported).  (around line 422)
- Risk scenario: java.util.Random is predictable from a few outputs; session ids, OTPs, reset tokens or keys built from it can be guessed.
- Fix: Use java.security.SecureRandom (and never a fixed seed) for tokens, PINs, salts, IVs and keys.

#### 12. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Utilities.Tools`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 40)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 13. [HIGH] Weak cipher mode: ECB ("RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding")

- Location: `org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Utilities.SecretKeyWrapper`
- CWE: CWE-327 | OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: crypto-cipher | Scope: APP
- Priority: 70/100 (P1)
- Why flagged: Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding") uses ECB (a bare "AES"/"DES" defaults to ECB on Android): identical plaintext blocks give identical ciphertext blocks, leaking structure and allowing block swapping.  (around line 28)
- Risk scenario: DES/RC4/MD5/ECB-mode data can be decrypted or forged much faster than the key length suggests. ECB shows patterns (equal blocks give equal ciphertext) and has no integrity.
- Fix: Use AES/GCM/NoPadding with a fresh random 12-byte IV per message (or AES/CBC + HMAC if GCM is not possible).

#### 14. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Activities.BaseActivity`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 58)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 15. [LOW] Possible sensitive data in logs

- Location: `org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Tasks.AuthenticationTask`
- CWE: CWE-532 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: log-sensitive-strings | Scope: APP
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A string passed near a Log call mentions a credential-like word ("Problem decoding password"). Logcat output can be read by other apps with the right permission on many devices.  (around line 145)
- Risk scenario: On older Android versions (and with adb or a bug-report) logs are readable; secrets that reach Log.d end up in files and crash reports.
- Fix: Never log passwords, tokens, or session identifiers, even at debug level; strip such log calls from release builds.

#### 16. [MEDIUM] QR/barcode input reaches a sensitive sink

- Location: `org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.View.EntriesCardAdapter`
- CWE: CWE-20 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: LOW | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 27/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: This class scans QR/barcodes and also calls a sensitive API (Landroid/content/Context;->startActivity). A malicious QR code is attacker-controlled input; if it is used unvalidated, it can open arbitrary URLs/intents or inject SQL/commands.  (around line 706)
- Risk scenario: Data from an Intent, deep link, QR code or server is trusted without checks, so it can steer the app into unintended screens, URLs or file operations.
- Fix: Treat the scanned text as untrusted: validate scheme/host against an allow-list, never pass it straight to WebView/Intent/SQL.

#### 17. [MEDIUM] Password screen not protected against tapjacking (x5)

- Location: `res/layout/content_authenticate.xml`
- CWE: CWE-1021 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: tapjacking-sensitive-layout
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: This layout has a password field ("@0x7f0a01b9") and no view in it sets android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true", so a malicious overlay can sit on top of the screen and the field still receives the taps (tapjacking). No code mitigation (setFilterTouchesWhenObscured, onFilterTouchEventForSecurity, setHideOverlayWindows) is referenced anywhere in the app's dex. minSdkVersion is 22: devices below Android 12 do not block touches through overlays.  [res/layout/content_authenticate.xml]  The same applies to 4 more layout(s): res/layout/component_intro_authentication.xml, res/layout/component_authentication.xml, res/layout/component_password.xml, res/layout/dialog_password_entry.xml.
- Risk scenario: A malicious app draws a transparent or misleading overlay on top of a login or payment screen; the user's taps go through to the real buttons or the overlay captures what is typed.
- Fix: Set android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true" on the root of this layout (or call setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(true) on it / getWindow().setHideOverlayWindows(true) on API 31+ in the Activity).

#### 18. [LOW] Keyboard cache: sensitive input field (x2)

- Location: `res/layout/mtrl_picker_text_input_date_range.xml`
- CWE: CWE-524 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The field "(id not resolved)" looks sensitive or is the main input of this screen, but its inputType (0x14) does not disable suggestions. The keyboard may learn and cache what is typed (autocorrect dictionary, predictive text).  [res/layout/mtrl_picker_text_input_date_range.xml]  The same applies to 1 more layout(s): res/layout/mtrl_picker_text_input_date.xml.
- Risk scenario: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.
- Fix: Use android:inputType="textPassword" (or textNoSuggestions|textVisiblePassword) and consider importantForAutofill="no" for secrets.

#### 19. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input chooses the server the app contacts

- Location: `org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Database.Entry`
- CWE: CWE-918 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE / MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getDataString() reaches URL.<init>() in method Entry.<init>(Ljava/lang/String;)V. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value travels through 2 methods. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field. The chain also contains validation-like calls (startsWith, matches, getHost, canonical path, allow-list contains ...): verify that they really restrict this value before the sink.
- Risk scenario: When a deep link, Intent extra or web page decides which host the app connects to, an attacker can point it at an internal service, a server that logs the app's headers and tokens, or a cleartext endpoint.
- Fix: Allow-list the host (and use https) before opening the connection; resolve a small id to a fixed URL on your side.

#### 20. [LOW] Untrusted input chooses the file or content URI the app opens

- Location: `org.shadowice.flocke.andotp.Utilities.StorageAccessHelper`
- CWE: CWE-73 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getData() in onActivityResult reaches ContentResolver.openInputStream() in method StorageAccessHelper.loadFile(Landroid/content/Context;Landroid/net/Uri;)[B. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value travels through 3 methods. The Intent is the result that an activity this app started handed back to onActivityResult (a file picker, the camera, one of its own screens), not an input that another app sends to a component of this app. It is attacker-controlled only if the app starts an implicit Intent that another app can answer, or the activity it calls is untrusted (low confidence); check which activity is started and whether the Intent is explicit.
- Risk scenario: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.
- Fix: Accept only the content:// authorities you expect (reject file:// and your own FileProvider/app-private paths) before opening a URI that came from an Intent; copy with a fixed name and cap the size.

### Remediation guide

One entry per weakness type found above.

#### CWE-530 - Exposure of Backup File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="false" android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules" ...>
<!-- or keep backup and exclude secrets with fullBackupContent / dataExtractionRules -->
```

#### CWE-319 - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" ...>
val url = "http://api.example.com/login"   // plain HTTP
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true" />   <!-- every domain may use plain HTTP -->
</network-security-config>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="false" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" ...>
val url = "https://api.example.com/login"   // TLS
<!-- res/xml/network_security_config.xml -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" />
</network-security-config>
<!-- only if one legacy host really needs HTTP: scope it to that host, never to base-config -->
<domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
    <domain includeSubdomains="false">legacy.example.com</domain>
</domain-config>
```

#### CWE-926 - Improper Export of Android Application Components

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="true" />
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="normal" />   <!-- any app can request it -->
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" />   <!-- writes are open -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="false" />
<!-- if another app must call it: android:permission="com.example.PERM" with protectionLevel="signature", and validate every extra -->
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="signature" />
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" android:writePermission="com.example.WRITE" />
```

#### CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = true
<provider android:exported="true" android:grantUriPermissions="true" ... />   <!-- every path can be handed out -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = false
webSettings.allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs = false
<provider android:exported="false" android:grantUriPermissions="false" ...>
    <grant-uri-permission android:pathPrefix="/shared/" />   <!-- only the paths that must be shared -->
</provider>
```

#### CWE-328 - Use of Weak Hash

OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO

Risk: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-1").digest(data)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256").digest(data)
// passwords: use a slow KDF (PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 with 600000+ iterations, Argon2id, scrypt)
```

#### CWE-327 - Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO

Risk: DES/RC4/MD5/ECB-mode data can be decrypted or forged much faster than the key length suggests. ECB shows patterns (equal blocks give equal ciphertext) and has no integrity.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
Cipher.getInstance("AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding")
MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5")
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding")        // authenticated encryption
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key)                        // let the provider create a fresh random IV
val iv = cipher.iv; val ct = cipher.doFinal(plain)           // store iv next to ct
// hashing: SHA-256 or better; passwords: PBKDF2 / Argon2 / scrypt, never a plain hash
```

#### CWE-338 - Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG

OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO

Risk: java.util.Random is predictable from a few outputs; session ids, OTPs, reset tokens or keys built from it can be guessed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val otp = Random().nextInt(999999)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val otp = SecureRandom().nextInt(1_000_000)
```

#### CWE-532 - Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: On older Android versions (and with adb or a bug-report) logs are readable; secrets that reach Log.d end up in files and crash reports.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
Log.d("Login", "user=" + user + " password=" + password)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) Log.d("Login", "login attempt")      // never log credentials or tokens
// release builds: strip logs with R8 (-assumenosideeffects class android.util.Log { *; })
```

#### CWE-20 - Improper Input Validation

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: Data from an Intent, deep link, QR code or server is trusted without checks, so it can steer the app into unintended screens, URLs or file operations.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val url = intent.getStringExtra("url"); webView.loadUrl(url!!)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val url = intent.getStringExtra("url")
val u = url?.let { Uri.parse(it) }
if (u?.scheme == "https" && u.host in ALLOWED_HOSTS) webView.loadUrl(url) else finish()
```

#### CWE-1021 - Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames (Tapjacking)

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: A malicious app draws a transparent or misleading overlay on top of a login or payment screen; the user's taps go through to the real buttons or the overlay captures what is typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword" ... />   <!-- no filterTouchesWhenObscured -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<LinearLayout android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true" ...>
// or, API 31+: window.setHideOverlayWindows(true)  (needs HIDE_OVERLAY_WINDOWS)
```

#### CWE-524 - Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="text" />   <!-- password-like field with suggestions on -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword|textNoSuggestions" android:importantForAutofill="no" />
```

#### CWE-918 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE / MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: When a deep link, Intent extra or web page decides which host the app connects to, an attacker can point it at an internal service, a server that logs the app's headers and tokens, or a cleartext endpoint.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val url = intent.getStringExtra("endpoint")
val conn = URL(url).openConnection()      // host chosen by the caller
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val id = intent.getStringExtra("endpoint")
val url = ENDPOINTS[id] ?: return          // fixed allow-list, https only
val conn = URL(url).openConnection()
```

#### CWE-73 - External Control of File Name or Path

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri"); contentResolver.openInputStream(uri!!)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri")
if (uri?.scheme == "content" && uri.authority in ALLOWED_AUTHORITIES) contentResolver.openInputStream(uri)
```
