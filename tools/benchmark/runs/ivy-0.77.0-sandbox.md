| Severity | Count |
|---|---|
| HIGH | 2 |
| MEDIUM | 21 |
| LOW | 31 |

**OWASP Mobile Top 10 (2024) coverage**

- M8 Security Misconfiguration: 8
- M9 Insecure Data Storage: 7
- M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization: 6
- M10 Insufficient Cryptography: 4
- M5 Insecure Communication: 1
- M1 Improper Credential Usage: 1

### Findings

#### 1. [HIGH] Cleartext (plain HTTP) traffic allowed

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-cleartext-traffic
- Priority: 70/100 (P1)
- Why flagged: android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" lets the app make plain HTTP requests. Anyone sharing the network (public Wi-Fi, a compromised router) can read or tamper with that traffic.
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Set usesCleartextTraffic to "false" and use HTTPS everywhere; if a few hosts genuinely need HTTP, scope that with a network security config instead of a blanket allow.

#### 2. [MEDIUM] Exported activity without a permission: androidx.compose.ui.tooling.PreviewActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 3. [LOW] Legacy external storage requested

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-legacy-external-storage
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" opts out of scoped storage, so files the app writes to shared storage stay readable (and replaceable) by other apps that hold the storage permission.
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Migrate to scoped storage (MediaStore / SAF / getExternalFilesDir) and remove the flag.

#### 4. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `y0.h`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 439)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 5. [MEDIUM] Weak hash: MD5

- Location: `H0.b`
- CWE: CWE-328 | OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: crypto-weak-hash | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: MD5 is broken for integrity/signature purposes (practical collisions); fine only as a non-security checksum.  (around line 130)
- Risk scenario: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.
- Fix: Use SHA-256+ for integrity; for passwords use a salted KDF (PBKDF2/bcrypt/Argon2), never a raw hash.

#### 6. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `G2.l`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 147)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 7. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `E2.a`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 52)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 8. [LOW] Sensitive value written to log

- Location: `O3.k`
- CWE: CWE-532 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 14/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered one level: heuristic finding inside obfuscated (likely third-party) code.
- Why flagged: A log call is built from a credential-like label ("X-CRASHLYTICS-DEVELOPER-TOKEN") plus an appended variable. Logcat can be read from a computer over ADB, and by other apps on some devices.  (around line 2411)
- Risk scenario: On older Android versions (and with adb or a bug-report) logs are readable; secrets that reach Log.d end up in files and crash reports.
- Fix: Never log passwords, tokens, or personal data; strip such Log calls from release builds.

#### 9. [LOW] Firebase Firestore SDK used

- Location: `O3.k`
- CWE: CWE-284 | OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-AUTH / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: This class initializes/uses the Firebase Firestore SDK. No literal database URL turned up nearby in this class (it may come from google-services.json's generated resources, a remote config, or a different class) - but the app does talk to a Firebase backend, so its security rules matter just as much as if the URL were visible here.  (around line 1112)
- Risk scenario: Data or functions are reachable without a proper check: for example an open Firebase database or a provider anyone can query. A Firebase Realtime Database URL in the resources is not a flaw by itself: the question is whether its rules allow public reads or writes, because the URL is readable by anyone who unpacks the APK.
- Fix: Confirm the project's rules require authentication rather than the default public "test mode" (which Firebase itself only allows temporarily, but is often left in place). Review the Firestore rules in the Firebase console (each collection, not just the root).

#### 10. [LOW] Temp file created

- Location: `U5.E`
- CWE: CWE-377 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app creates a temp file. If sensitive content is written and the file is not deleted (or sits in a shared directory) other code can read it.  (around line 899)
- Risk scenario: A predictable temp file in a shared folder can be pre-created or replaced by another app.
- Fix: Write temp data under the app's private cacheDir, delete it as soon as it is used, and never put secrets in it unencrypted.

#### 11. [MEDIUM] Possible Zip Slip (unsanitized zip entry path)

- Location: `la.j`
- CWE: CWE-22 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: zip-slip | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 33/100 (P3)
- Note: Lowered one level: heuristic finding inside obfuscated (likely third-party) code.
- Why flagged: This method reads ZipEntry.getName() while extracting an archive and builds a File/output path from it, with no getCanonicalPath()/normalize() check anywhere in the method. A crafted entry name containing "../" segments can write outside the intended extraction directory (e.g. overwrite app files or drop an executable in a sensitive location).  (around line 5247)
- Risk scenario: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).
- Fix: Resolve the destination file, call getCanonicalPath() on it, and verify it still starts with the intended output directory before writing; reject/skip any entry that fails the check.

#### 12. [MEDIUM] Java deserialization (ObjectInputStream.readObject)

- Location: `x2.h`
- CWE: CWE-502 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: deserialization | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Deserializing data that an attacker can influence (file, socket, Intent extra) can instantiate arbitrary classes and run gadget chains.  (around line 121)
- Risk scenario: A crafted serialized object can instantiate unexpected classes while it is read (gadget chains) and lead to code execution, denial of service or tampered state.
- Fix: Prefer a data format (JSON/Protobuf) with an explicit schema; if Serializable is required, use an ObjectInputFilter allow-list.

#### 13. [LOW] Weak hash: SHA-1

- Location: `I4.h`
- CWE: CWE-328 | OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: crypto-weak-hash | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: SHA-1 is deprecated for security use (collision attacks exist); not safe for certificates or signatures.  (around line 443)
- Risk scenario: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.
- Fix: Use SHA-256 or better.

#### 14. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `I4.u`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 568)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 15. [LOW] Firebase Firestore SDK used

- Location: `C4.a`
- CWE: CWE-284 | OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-AUTH / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: This class initializes/uses the Firebase Firestore SDK. No literal database URL turned up nearby in this class (it may come from google-services.json's generated resources, a remote config, or a different class) - but the app does talk to a Firebase backend, so its security rules matter just as much as if the URL were visible here.  (around line 203)
- Risk scenario: Data or functions are reachable without a proper check: for example an open Firebase database or a provider anyone can query. A Firebase Realtime Database URL in the resources is not a flaw by itself: the question is whether its rules allow public reads or writes, because the URL is readable by anyone who unpacks the APK.
- Fix: Confirm the project's rules require authentication rather than the default public "test mode" (which Firebase itself only allows temporarily, but is often left in place). Review the Firestore rules in the Firebase console (each collection, not just the root).

#### 16. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `Z8.b`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 207)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 17. [MEDIUM] Code loaded from another app's package context

- Location: `H3.c`
- CWE: CWE-94 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: package-context-code | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 33/100 (P3)
- Note: Lowered one level: heuristic finding inside obfuscated (likely third-party) code.
- Why flagged: createPackageContext() is called with CONTEXT_INCLUDE_CODE and the resulting context's class loader is used, and no signature check of the target package is visible. Any app installed under that package name runs its code inside this process.  (around line 1547)
- Risk scenario: Code loaded at runtime from a writable, downloaded or attacker-reachable location executes with the app's permissions, so replacing that file means running the attacker's code.
- Fix: Do not load code from other apps. If you must, verify the package signature with PackageManager.checkSignatures / signing certificates first and drop CONTEXT_IGNORE_SECURITY.

#### 18. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `Y1.f`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 145)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 19. [HIGH] Untrusted input selects a class or method by name

- Location: `S1.b`
- CWE: CWE-470 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 60/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getExtras() reaches Class.forName() in method q(): the caller picks which class is loaded and initialised. The value was followed through registers, fields and calls inside this class and no sanitizer was seen on the way. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field.  (around line 230)
- Risk scenario: A class or method name coming from outside lets the attacker pick which code runs.
- Fix: Look the name up in an explicit allow-list (a map of known keys to classes) instead of passing it to Class.forName / getMethod.

#### 20. [LOW] Weak hash: SHA-1

- Location: `o5.c`
- CWE: CWE-328 | OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: crypto-weak-hash | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: SHA-1 is deprecated for security use (collision attacks exist); not safe for certificates or signatures.  (around line 916)
- Risk scenario: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.
- Fix: Use SHA-256 or better.

#### 21. [LOW] Weak hash: SHA-1

- Location: `n5.b`
- CWE: CWE-328 | OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: crypto-weak-hash | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: SHA-1 is deprecated for security use (collision attacks exist); not safe for certificates or signatures.  (around line 241)
- Risk scenario: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.
- Fix: Use SHA-256 or better.

#### 22. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `x4.f`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 911)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 23. [LOW] Possible SQL built by string concatenation

- Location: `Y5.j`
- CWE: CWE-89 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: sql-concat | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 14/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered one level: heuristic finding inside obfuscated (likely third-party) code.
- Why flagged: rawQuery/execSQL is called shortly after building a string with StringBuilder - a common pattern for SQL assembled from variables. If any part comes from outside input, it can be SQL-injectable.  (around line 2680)
- Risk scenario: Input such as ' OR '1'='1 changes the meaning of the query: an attacker (or another app calling an exported ContentProvider) can read other rows, bypass a login check or modify data.
- Fix: Use parameterized queries ('?' placeholders + selectionArgs) instead of concatenating values into the SQL text.

#### 24. [LOW] Temp file created

- Location: `Y5.n`
- CWE: CWE-377 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app creates a temp file. If sensitive content is written and the file is not deleted (or sits in a shared directory) other code can read it.  (around line 596)
- Risk scenario: A predictable temp file in a shared folder can be pre-created or replaced by another app.
- Fix: Write temp data under the app's private cacheDir, delete it as soon as it is used, and never put secrets in it unencrypted.

#### 25. [MEDIUM] Sensitive data stored in plain SQLite (x2)

- Location: `e5.D`
- CWE: CWE-312 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: sqlite-unencrypted | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Private data is written to a plain (unencrypted) SQLite database: the column "resume_token" (CREATE TABLE column). The database file sits in /data/data/<package>/databases and is readable on a rooted device, from an adb backup (allowBackup) or a forensic image. No hash or cipher call was seen on the value in this method (SSA backward slice; values from other methods are not followed).  (around line 122)
- Risk scenario: Anyone with the device in hand, a backup, a rooted phone or another app exploiting a file leak can read tokens, passwords or personal data stored in plain text.
- Fix: Do not keep credentials in a database at all (store a salted hash or a revocable token). For private data use SQLCipher (net.zetetic:sqlcipher-android) or encrypt the values with a key from the Android Keystore; set allowBackup=false or exclude the database from backups.

#### 26. [LOW] Firebase Firestore SDK used

- Location: `a5.c`
- CWE: CWE-284 | OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-AUTH / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: This class initializes/uses the Firebase Firestore SDK. No literal database URL turned up nearby in this class (it may come from google-services.json's generated resources, a remote config, or a different class) - but the app does talk to a Firebase backend, so its security rules matter just as much as if the URL were visible here.  (around line 9)

#### 29. [MEDIUM] Code loaded from another app's package context

- Location: `L3.a`
- CWE: CWE-94 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: package-context-code | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 33/100 (P3)
- Note: Lowered one level: heuristic finding inside obfuscated (likely third-party) code.
- Why flagged: createPackageContext() is called with CONTEXT_INCLUDE_CODE and the resulting context's class loader is used, and no signature check of the target package is visible. Any app installed under that package name runs its code inside this process.  (around line 175)

#### 30. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `N1.g`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 392)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 31. [LOW] Dynamic code loading

- Location: `k5.d`
- CWE: CWE-94 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: dynamic-code-loading | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 14/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered one level: heuristic finding inside obfuscated (likely third-party) code.
- Why flagged: The app loads code at runtime (DexClassLoader & co). If the dex/jar comes from a writable or downloaded location without integrity checks, an attacker can swap it and run code with the app's permissions.  (around line 908)
- Risk scenario: Code loaded at runtime from a writable, downloaded or attacker-reachable location executes with the app's permissions, so replacing that file means running the attacker's code.
- Fix: Load code only from app-private, read-only storage, verify a signature/hash, or bundle it in the APK.

#### 32. [LOW] Google API key in resources

- Location: `resources.arsc`
- CWE: CWE-798 | OWASP: M1 Improper Credential Usage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: res-strings-google-api-key
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A Google API key (AIzaSy... (39 chars)) is stored in the app resources. The APK also has a Firebase app id, so this is the standard client key of google-services: it is meant to ship in the app, but it is only safe when it is restricted. Check it in the Google Cloud console (Credentials).  [resources.arsc]
- Risk scenario: Anyone can unzip the APK (or run strings on the dex) and read the key, token or password. A leaked cloud/API key lets the attacker call the backend as the app, run up the bill, or read other users' data. Removing it in the next release does not help: old APKs stay in the wild, so the key must be rotated. Resources are no hiding place: res/values/strings.xml is compiled into resources.arsc, and apktool or a plain unzip shows every string. Tokens (JWT) can be decoded by anyone, and a Google / Firebase API key is only safe when it is restricted to your app.
- Fix: Restrict the key to this app (package name + SHA-1) and to the APIs you use, set a quota alert, and rotate it if it was ever unrestricted.

#### 33. [MEDIUM] Firebase Realtime Database URL

- Location: `resources.arsc`
- CWE: CWE-284 | OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-AUTH / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: res-strings-firebase-url
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: The app resources contain a Firebase Realtime Database URL (https://ivy-widget.firebaseio.com). The URL alone is not a flaw, but if the database rules allow public reads or writes, anyone can dump or change the data. This cannot be checked statically.  [resources.arsc]
- Risk scenario: Data or functions are reachable without a proper check: for example an open Firebase database or a provider anyone can query. A Firebase Realtime Database URL in the resources is not a flaw by itself: the question is whether its rules allow public reads or writes, because the URL is readable by anyone who unpacks the APK.
- Fix: Open this URL + "/.json" from a test device you own: if it returns data, the database rules allow public reads. Lock the rules down (auth != null) and require authentication.

#### 34. [LOW] Keyboard cache: sensitive input field (x2)

- Location: `res/66.xml`
- CWE: CWE-524 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The field "(id not resolved)" looks sensitive or is the main input of this screen, but its inputType (not set) does not disable suggestions. The keyboard may learn and cache what is typed (autocorrect dictionary, predictive text).  [res/66.xml]  The same applies to 1 more layout(s): res/J7.xml.
- Risk scenario: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.
- Fix: Use android:inputType="textPassword" (or textNoSuggestions|textVisiblePassword) and consider importantForAutofill="no" for secrets.

#### 35. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input reaches an SQL statement

- Priority: 33/100 (P3)
- Note: Lowered one level: heuristic finding inside obfuscated (likely third-party) code.
- Why flagged: Data from Parcel.readString() (through field m.r:Ljava/lang/Object; (written in v.c()V)) reaches SQLiteDatabase.rawQueryWithFactory() in method m.H()Landroid/database/Cursor;. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value is read from a Parcel inside an unmarshalling method (a Parcelable constructor, createFromParcel, readFromParcel or a Binder onTransact). The Parcel is filled by another app when the object is received through an Intent extra or an exported service: check where this class is read from an Intent or Binder call. 2 flows of this kind end in this method.
- Risk scenario: Input such as ' OR '1'='1 changes the meaning of the query: an attacker (or another app calling an exported ContentProvider) can read other rows, bypass a login check or modify data.
- Fix: Use selection arguments (?) or Room parameters for every value; never concatenate input into SQL. Allow-list table, column and ORDER BY names.

The value is read from a Parcel inside an unmarshalling method (a Parcelable constructor, createFromParcel, readFromParcel or a Binder onTransact). The Parcel is filled by another app when the object is received through an Intent extra or an exported service: check where this class is read from an Intent or Binder call.
- Risk scenario: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).

### Remediation guide

One entry per weakness type found above.

#### CWE-319 - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" ...>
val url = "http://api.example.com/login"   // plain HTTP
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true" />   <!-- every domain may use plain HTTP -->
</network-security-config>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="false" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" ...>
val url = "https://api.example.com/login"   // TLS
<!-- res/xml/network_security_config.xml -->

    <domain includeSubdomains="false">legacy.example.com</domain>
</domain-config>
```

#### CWE-926 - Improper Export of Android Application Components

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="true" />
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="normal" />   <!-- any app can request it -->
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" />   <!-- writes are open -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="false" />
<!-- if another app must call it: android:permission="com.example.PERM" with protectionLevel="signature", and validate every extra -->
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="signature" />
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" android:writePermission="com.example.WRITE" />
```

#### CWE-922 - Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "export.json").writeText(json)
<application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
File(filesDir, "export.json").writeText(json)          // app-private storage
// to share: use a FileProvider with a narrow path and grant temporary URI permission
// scoped storage: remove requestLegacyExternalStorage; use MediaStore, the Storage Access Framework or getExternalFilesDir
```

#### CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = true
<provider android:exported="true" android:grantUriPermissions="true" ... />   <!-- every path can be handed out -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = false
webSettings.allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs = false
<provider android:exported="false" android:grantUriPermissions="false" ...>
    <grant-uri-permission android:pathPrefix="/shared/" />   <!-- only the paths that must be shared -->
</provider>
```

#### CWE-328 - Use of Weak Hash

OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO

Risk: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-1").digest(data)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256").digest(data)
// passwords: use a slow KDF (PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 with 600000+ iterations, Argon2id, scrypt)
```

#### CWE-532 - Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: On older Android versions (and with adb or a bug-report) logs are readable; secrets that reach Log.d end up in files and crash reports.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
Log.d("Login", "user=" + user + " password=" + password)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) Log.d("Login", "login attempt")      // never log credentials or tokens
// release builds: strip logs with R8 (-assumenosideeffects class android.util.Log { *; })
```

#### CWE-284 - Improper Access Control

OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-AUTH / MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Data or functions are reachable without a proper check: for example an open Firebase database or a provider anyone can query. A Firebase Realtime Database URL in the resources is not a flaw by itself: the question is whether its rules allow public reads or writes, because the URL is readable by anyone who unpacks the APK.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
// Firebase rules: { ".read": true, ".write": true }
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// Firebase rules: only authenticated users, only their own node
{ "rules": { "users": { "uid": { ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == 'uid'" } } } }
// test your own database from a device you own: open PROJECT-ID.firebaseio.com/.json  -> it must answer Permission denied
```

#### CWE-377 - Insecure Temporary File

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A predictable temp file in a shared folder can be pre-created or replaced by another app.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
File("/sdcard/tmp_" + id)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
File.createTempFile("tmp_", ".bin", cacheDir)   // app-private cache
```

#### CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (Path Traversal)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val out = File(dir, entry.name)            // entry.name may contain ../
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val out = File(dir, entry.name).canonicalFile
if (!out.path.startsWith(dir.canonicalPath + File.separator)) throw SecurityException("bad path")
```

#### CWE-502 - Deserialization of Untrusted Data

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: A crafted serialized object can instantiate unexpected classes while it is read (gadget chains) and lead to code execution, denial of service or tampered state.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val obj = ObjectInputStream(input).readObject()
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// use a data-only format with a schema (JSON / Protobuf) and validate every field
val dto = Json.decodeFromString<Message>(text)
// if Java serialization is unavoidable: set an ObjectInputFilter allow-list
```

#### CWE-94 - Improper Control of Generation of Code (Code Injection)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: Code loaded at runtime from a writable, downloaded or attacker-reachable location executes with the app's permissions, so replacing that file means running the attacker's code.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
DexClassLoader(File(getExternalFilesDir(null), "plugin.dex").path, optDir, null, classLoader)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// ship the code in the APK, or download it over HTTPS, verify a signature, and keep it in app-private storage (read-only after verification)
val f = File(filesDir, "plugin.dex"); verifySignature(f); f.setReadOnly()
```

#### CWE-470 - Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code (Unsafe Reflection)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: A class or method name coming from outside lets the attacker pick which code runs.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
Class.forName(intent.getStringExtra("cls")).newInstance()
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val handlers = mapOf("a" to ::HandlerA, "b" to ::HandlerB)     // explicit allow-list
val h = handlers[intent.getStringExtra("cls")]?.invoke() ?: return
```

#### CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (SQL Injection)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-CODE

Risk: Input such as ' OR '1'='1 changes the meaning of the query: an attacker (or another app calling an exported ContentProvider) can read other rows, bypass a login check or modify data.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + name + "'", null)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?", arrayOf(name))   // bound parameter
// ContentProvider.query: pass selection with ? and selectionArgs, never concatenate them
```

#### CWE-312 - Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: Anyone with the device in hand, a backup, a rooted phone or another app exploiting a file leak can read tokens, passwords or personal data stored in plain text.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
prefs.edit().putString("password", password).apply()
db.execSQL("INSERT INTO users(pin) VALUES ('" + pin + "')")
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// store a token (not the password) and encrypt it with a Keystore-backed AES-GCM key
val sealed = keystoreCipher.encrypt(token.toByteArray())     // see CWE-321 sample for the key
prefs.edit().putString("token", Base64.encodeToString(sealed, Base64.NO_WRAP)).apply()
// database: SQLCipher or per-field encryption; never keep the password itself
```

#### CWE-798 - Use of Hard-coded Credentials

OWASP: M1 Improper Credential Usage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-CRYPTO

Risk: Anyone can unzip the APK (or run strings on the dex) and read the key, token or password. A leaked cloud/API key lets the attacker call the backend as the app, run up the bill, or read other users' data. Removing it in the next release does not help: old APKs stay in the wild, so the key must be rotated. Resources are no hiding place: res/values/strings.xml is compiled into resources.arsc, and apktool or a plain unzip shows every string. Tokens (JWT) can be decoded by anyone, and a Google / Firebase API key is only safe when it is restricted to your app.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
const val API_KEY = "EXAMPLE_ONLY_NOT_A_REAL_KEY"   // shipped inside every APK
val client = Api(API_KEY)
<!-- res/values/strings.xml: this ends up readable inside resources.arsc -->
<string name="api_secret">EXAMPLE_ONLY_NOT_A_REAL_KEY</string>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// keep the secret on YOUR server; the app only holds a short-lived user token
val token = authRepository.sessionToken()      // issued after login, expires, revocable
val client = Api(token)
// if a client key is unavoidable: restrict it (package name + SHA-256 cert, API scope, quota) and rotate it
// Google / Firebase API key in strings.xml: in the Cloud console restrict it to Android apps (package name + SHA-1) and to the APIs you use
<!-- strings.xml keeps only public identifiers; secrets and long-lived tokens stay on your backend -->
```

#### CWE-524 - Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="text" />   <!-- password-like field with suggestions on -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword|textNoSuggestions" android:importantForAutofill="no" />
```

#### CWE-73 - External Control of File Name or Path

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri"); contentResolver.openInputStream(uri!!)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri")
if (uri?.scheme == "content" && uri.authority in ALLOWED_AUTHORITIES) contentResolver.openInputStream(uri)
```
