### Findings

#### 1. [MEDIUM] Backup allowed (allowBackup)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-530 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-allow-backup
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: android:allowBackup is not explicitly "false" (it defaults to true). Via `adb backup` (no root needed on many OS versions) or a cloud backup, the app's private data - databases, SharedPreferences, saved tokens - can be extracted.
- Risk scenario: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.
- Fix: Set android:allowBackup="false", or if backups are wanted, add a dataExtractionRules/fullBackupContent file that explicitly excludes anything sensitive.

#### 2. [HIGH] Cleartext (plain HTTP) traffic allowed

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-cleartext-traffic
- Priority: 70/100 (P1)
- Why flagged: android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" lets the app make plain HTTP requests. Anyone sharing the network (public Wi-Fi, a compromised router) can read or tamper with that traffic.
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Set usesCleartextTraffic to "false" and use HTTPS everywhere; if a few hosts genuinely need HTTP, scope that with a network security config instead of a blanket allow.

#### 3. [LOW] Exported activity without a permission: other.writeily.widget.WrWidgetConfigure

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered to LOW: exported by design (public entry action: APPWIDGET_CONFIGURE).
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 4. [MEDIUM] Exported activity without a permission: net.gsantner.markor.activity.DocumentActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 5. [LOW] Exported activity-alias without a permission: net.gsantner.markor.AliasDocumentProcessText

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered to LOW: exported by design (public entry action: PROCESS_TEXT).
- Why flagged: This activity-alias is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 6. [MEDIUM] Powerful permissions requested (2)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-250 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-powerful-permissions
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: - REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES: can install other APKs
- MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: all-files access to shared storage
- Risk scenario: Extra privileges (debuggable, test-only, shared user id, legacy storage) widen what a compromise or a malicious app can reach. Powerful permissions (SMS, overlay, install packages) and an AccessibilityService give a compromised app, or overlay and banking malware, far more reach than the feature needs.
- Fix: Request only what the feature really needs, and prefer the narrower alternative (photo picker, SAF, SMS Retriever / User Consent API instead of READ_SMS).

#### 7. [LOW] Low minSdkVersion (18)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Confidence: LOW | Rule: manifest-min-sdk
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Supporting API < 23 (Android 6) means the app can run on devices without runtime permission prompts and with older TLS/cipher defaults.
- Fix: Raise minSdkVersion if the user base allows it; otherwise double check that sensitive permissions and network calls are still handled safely on the oldest supported devices.

#### 8. [LOW] Legacy external storage requested

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-legacy-external-storage
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" opts out of scoped storage, so files the app writes to shared storage stay readable (and replaceable) by other apps that hold the storage permission.
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Migrate to scoped storage (MediaStore / SAF / getExternalFilesDir) and remove the flag.

#### 9. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `net.gsantner.markor.model.AppSettings`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 844)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 10. [MEDIUM] Hardcoded sensitive field: TEXT_TOKEN

- Location: `net.gsantner.markor.activity.DocumentShareIntoFragment`
- CWE: CWE-798 | OWASP: M1 Improper Credential Usage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: secrets-sensitive-fields | Scope: APP
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: A field named like a credential is initialised with a fixed secret-looking string ("{{t…", 8 chars), so it is baked into the APK and readable after decompiling.  (around line 17)
- Risk scenario: Anyone can unzip the APK (or run strings on the dex) and read the key, token or password. A leaked cloud/API key lets the attacker call the backend as the app, run up the bill, or read other users' data. Removing it in the next release does not help: old APKs stay in the wild, so the key must be rotated. Resources are no hiding place: res/values/strings.xml is compiled into resources.arsc, and apktool or a plain unzip shows every string. Tokens (JWT) can be decoded by anyone, and a Google / Firebase API key is only safe when it is restricted to your app.
- Fix: Load this from a secure backend at runtime, or store it via the Android Keystore - don't compile it into the APK.

#### 11. [MEDIUM] WebView addJavascriptInterface

- Location: `net.gsantner.markor.activity.DocumentEditAndViewFragment`
- CWE: CWE-749 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: webview-js-interface | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: A Java/Kotlin object is bridged into a WebView's JavaScript context. Any page the WebView loads - including one reached via a hijacked link or a MITM'd connection - can call that object's @JavascriptInterface methods. The bridge is this class; none of its @JavascriptInterface methods reaches a file, process, Intent, database, preferences, account, location or reflection API, so a page can only call what you see there.  (around line 1300)
- Risk scenario: Every page the WebView loads (including injected ads or a hijacked link) can call the exposed @JavascriptInterface methods, for example to read files, tokens or start activities.
- Fix: Avoid exposing a JS interface to untrusted pages; restrict it to known HTTPS origins, or use WebMessageListener on modern APIs instead.

#### 12. [MEDIUM] Hardcoded sensitive field: HTML_TOKEN_ITEM_E

- Location: `net.gsantner.markor.format.markdown.MarkdownTextConverter`
- CWE: CWE-798 | OWASP: M1 Improper Credential Usage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: secrets-sensitive-fields | Scope: APP
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: A field named like a credential is initialised with a fixed secret-looking string ("</s…", 7 chars), so it is baked into the APK and readable after decompiling.  (around line 63)
- Risk scenario: Anyone can unzip the APK (or run strings on the dex) and read the key, token or password. A leaked cloud/API key lets the attacker call the backend as the app, run up the bill, or read other users' data. Removing it in the next release does not help: old APKs stay in the wild, so the key must be rotated. Resources are no hiding place: res/values/strings.xml is compiled into resources.arsc, and apktool or a plain unzip shows every string. Tokens (JWT) can be decoded by anyone, and a Google / Firebase API key is only safe when it is restricted to your app.
- Fix: Load this from a secure backend at runtime, or store it via the Android Keystore - don't compile it into the APK.

#### 13. [LOW] PendingIntent without FLAG_IMMUTABLE

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.util.GsContextUtils`
- CWE: CWE-927 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: pendingintent-mutable | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A mutable PendingIntent can be filled in by another app that receives it (changing action/extras), and Android 12+ requires you to choose explicitly.  (around line 9122)
- Risk scenario: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.
- Fix: Add PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE unless the receiver truly needs to modify it.

#### 14. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.util.GsContextUtils`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 8359)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 15. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.util.GsContextUtils`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 631)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 16. [LOW] Temp file created

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.util.GsContextUtils`
- CWE: CWE-377 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app creates a temp file. If sensitive content is written and the file is not deleted (or sits in a shared directory) other code can read it.  (around line 4340)
- Risk scenario: A predictable temp file in a shared folder can be pre-created or replaced by another app.
- Fix: Write temp data under the app's private cacheDir, delete it as soon as it is used, and never put secrets in it unencrypted.

#### 17. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.util.GsContextUtils`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 9600)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 18. [LOW] Untrusted input chooses the file or content URI the app opens (x2)

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.util.GsContextUtils`
- CWE: CWE-73 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getData() reaches ContentResolver.openFileDescriptor() in method extractResultFromActivityResult(): the caller picks the URI the app opens as a file descriptor. The value was followed through registers, fields and calls inside this class and no sanitizer was seen on the way. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field. The method also contains validation-like calls (startsWith, matches, getHost, canonical path, allow-list contains ...): verify that they really restrict this value before the sink.  (around line 4315)
- Risk scenario: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.
- Fix: Accept only the content:// authorities you expect (reject file:// and your own FileProvider/app-private paths) before opening a URI that came from an Intent; copy with a fixed name and cap the size.

#### 19. [MEDIUM] Shell command execution

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.util.GsFileUtils`
- CWE: CWE-78 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: shell-exec | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: The app runs an OS command via Runtime.exec/ProcessBuilder. If any part of that command comes from user input, an Intent extra, or a server response, this is a command-injection surface.  (around line 1159)
- Risk scenario: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).
- Fix: Trace where the command string comes from; avoid building it from untrusted input, or use a fixed allow-list of arguments instead of a shell string.

#### 20. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.frontend.filebrowser.GsFileBrowserListAdapter`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 1271)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 21. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.frontend.filebrowser.GsFileBrowserOptions$Options`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 283)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 22. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.frontend.settings.GsFontPreferenceCompat`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 1208)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 23. [MEDIUM] FileProvider shares too much (<external-path path=".">, <root-path path="/">)

- Location: `res/zz.xml`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: LOW | Rule: res-fileprovider-paths
- Priority: 27/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: These FileProvider paths cover a whole directory tree (the root of the file system or the app's private data: databases, shared_prefs, tokens). Any content:// URI the app hands out, or lets a caller choose, can then point at files that were never meant to be shared.  [res/zz.xml]
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: List only the specific sub-folder to share (for example path="shared/"), never root-path or path=".", and keep the provider exported="false" with grantUriPermissions="true".

#### 24. [MEDIUM] Credential-like value in string resources

- Location: `resources.arsc`
- CWE: CWE-798 | OWASP: M1 Improper Credential Usage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: res-strings-secret-names
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: String resources with a credential-like name and a random-looking value: pref_key__default_encryption_password = pref_k... (37 chars); pref_key__set_encryption_password = pref_k... (33 chars). The value is not a word, a reference or a placeholder.  [resources.arsc]
- Risk scenario: Anyone can unzip the APK (or run strings on the dex) and read the key, token or password. A leaked cloud/API key lets the attacker call the backend as the app, run up the bill, or read other users' data. Removing it in the next release does not help: old APKs stay in the wild, so the key must be rotated. Resources are no hiding place: res/values/strings.xml is compiled into resources.arsc, and apktool or a plain unzip shows every string. Tokens (JWT) can be decoded by anyone, and a Google / Firebase API key is only safe when it is restricted to your app.
- Fix: Remove the secret from the APK, rotate it (it must be treated as leaked), and keep it on a server you control; the app should call your backend instead.

#### 25. [LOW] Keyboard cache: sensitive input field (x2)

- Location: `res/J7.xml`
- CWE: CWE-524 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The field "(id not resolved)" looks sensitive or is the main input of this screen, but its inputType (0x14) does not disable suggestions. The keyboard may learn and cache what is typed (autocorrect dictionary, predictive text).  [res/J7.xml]  The same applies to 1 more layout(s): res/fu.xml.
- Risk scenario: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.
- Fix: Use android:inputType="textPassword" (or textNoSuggestions|textVisiblePassword) and consider importantForAutofill="no" for secrets.

#### 26. [HIGH] Untrusted input is used as a file path

- Location: `net.gsantner.markor.format.wikitext.WikitextTextConverter`
- CWE: CWE-22 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP
- Priority: 60/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getData() (through MarkorContextUtils.getIntentFile(Landroid/content/Intent;Landroid/content/Context;)Ljava/io/File;) reaches FileReader.<init>() in method WikitextTextConverter.isFileOutOfThisFormat(Ljava/io/File;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Z. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value travels through 6 methods. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field. The chain also contains validation-like calls (startsWith, matches, getHost, canonical path, allow-list contains ...): verify that they really restrict this value before the sink. 2 flows of this kind end in this method.
- Risk scenario: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).
- Fix: Reduce the input to a bare file name (File(name).name), resolve it against a fixed directory, call canonicalFile and check it still starts with that directory.

#### 27. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input is used as a file path

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.util.GsFileUtils`
- CWE: CWE-22 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP
- Priority: 27/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Data from SharedPreferences.getString() (through AppSettings.getAttachmentFolder(Ljava/io/File;)Ljava/io/File;) reaches FileOutputStream.<init>() in method GsFileUtils.copyFile(Ljava/io/File;Ljava/io/File;)Z. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value travels through 3 methods. The source is SharedPreferences, which only an attacker with root or a tampered backup can change: treat this as a lead, not as a confirmed flaw. The chain also contains validation-like calls (startsWith, matches, getHost, canonical path, allow-list contains ...): verify that they really restrict this value before the sink.
- Risk scenario: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).
- Fix: Reduce the input to a bare file name (File(name).name), resolve it against a fixed directory, call canonicalFile and check it still starts with that directory.

#### 28. [HIGH] Untrusted input is used as a file path

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.util.GsFileUtils`
- CWE: CWE-22 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP
- Priority: 60/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getData() reaches FileOutputStream.<init>() in method GsFileUtils.copyUriToFile(Landroid/content/Context;Landroid/net/Uri;Ljava/io/File;)V. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value travels through 2 methods. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field. The chain also contains validation-like calls (startsWith, matches, getHost, canonical path, allow-list contains ...): verify that they really restrict this value before the sink.
- Risk scenario: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).
- Fix: Reduce the input to a bare file name (File(name).name), resolve it against a fixed directory, call canonicalFile and check it still starts with that directory.

#### 29. [HIGH] Untrusted input is used as a file path

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.util.GsFileUtils`
- CWE: CWE-22 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP
- Priority: 60/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getData() (through MarkorContextUtils.getIntentFile(Landroid/content/Intent;Landroid/content/Context;)Ljava/io/File;) reaches FileInputStream.<init>() in method GsFileUtils.isContentsPlainText(Ljava/io/File;)Z. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value travels through 5 methods. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field. The chain also contains validation-like calls (startsWith, matches, getHost, canonical path, allow-list contains ...): verify that they really restrict this value before the sink. 2 flows of this kind end in this method.
- Risk scenario: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).

#### 30. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input is used as a file path

- Location: `net.gsantner.opoc.util.GsFileUtils`
- CWE: CWE-22 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP

One entry per weakness type found above.

#### CWE-530 - Exposure of Backup File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="false" android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules" ...>
<!-- or keep backup and exclude secrets with fullBackupContent / dataExtractionRules -->
```

#### CWE-319 - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" ...>
val url = "http://api.example.com/login"   // plain HTTP
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true" />   <!-- every domain may use plain HTTP -->
</network-security-config>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="false" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" ...>
val url = "https://api.example.com/login"   // TLS
<!-- res/xml/network_security_config.xml -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" />
</network-security-config>
<!-- only if one legacy host really needs HTTP: scope it to that host, never to base-config -->
<domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
    <domain includeSubdomains="false">legacy.example.com</domain>
</domain-config>
```

#### CWE-926 - Improper Export of Android Application Components

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="true" />
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="normal" />   <!-- any app can request it -->
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" />   <!-- writes are open -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="false" />
<!-- if another app must call it: android:permission="com.example.PERM" with protectionLevel="signature", and validate every extra -->
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="signature" />
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" android:writePermission="com.example.WRITE" />
```

#### CWE-250 - Execution with Unnecessary Privileges

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Extra privileges (debuggable, test-only, shared user id, legacy storage) widen what a compromise or a malicious app can reach. Powerful permissions (SMS, overlay, install packages) and an AccessibilityService give a compromised app, or overlay and banking malware, far more reach than the feature needs.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:debuggable="true" android:testOnly="true" ...>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS" />
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<!-- ship release builds without debuggable / testOnly; request only the permissions you use -->
<!-- OTP codes: SMS Retriever or SMS User Consent API instead of READ_SMS; files: photo picker or the Storage Access Framework -->
```

#### CWE-922 - Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "export.json").writeText(json)
<application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
File(filesDir, "export.json").writeText(json)          // app-private storage
// to share: use a FileProvider with a narrow path and grant temporary URI permission
// scoped storage: remove requestLegacyExternalStorage; use MediaStore, the Storage Access Framework or getExternalFilesDir
```

#### CWE-798 - Use of Hard-coded Credentials

OWASP: M1 Improper Credential Usage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-CRYPTO

Risk: Anyone can unzip the APK (or run strings on the dex) and read the key, token or password. A leaked cloud/API key lets the attacker call the backend as the app, run up the bill, or read other users' data. Removing it in the next release does not help: old APKs stay in the wild, so the key must be rotated. Resources are no hiding place: res/values/strings.xml is compiled into resources.arsc, and apktool or a plain unzip shows every string. Tokens (JWT) can be decoded by anyone, and a Google / Firebase API key is only safe when it is restricted to your app.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
const val API_KEY = "EXAMPLE_ONLY_NOT_A_REAL_KEY"   // shipped inside every APK
val client = Api(API_KEY)
<!-- res/values/strings.xml: this ends up readable inside resources.arsc -->
<string name="api_secret">EXAMPLE_ONLY_NOT_A_REAL_KEY</string>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// keep the secret on YOUR server; the app only holds a short-lived user token
val token = authRepository.sessionToken()      // issued after login, expires, revocable
val client = Api(token)
// if a client key is unavoidable: restrict it (package name + SHA-256 cert, API scope, quota) and rotate it
// Google / Firebase API key in strings.xml: in the Cloud console restrict it to Android apps (package name + SHA-1) and to the APIs you use
<!-- strings.xml keeps only public identifiers; secrets and long-lived tokens stay on your backend -->
```

#### CWE-749 - Exposed Dangerous Method or Function

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Every page the WebView loads (including injected ads or a hijacked link) can call the exposed @JavascriptInterface methods, for example to read files, tokens or start activities.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webView.addJavascriptInterface(Bridge(this), "app")
webView.loadUrl(urlFromIntent)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// load only your own HTTPS origins and expose nothing else
if (Uri.parse(url).host == "app.example.com") webView.loadUrl(url)
// modern alternative with an origin allow-list: WebViewCompat.addWebMessageListener(webView, "app", setOf("https://app.example.com"), listener)
```

#### CWE-927 - Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.example.TOKEN").putExtra("token", t))
PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, 0)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.example.TOKEN").setPackage(packageName).putExtra("token", t))
PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE)
```

#### CWE-377 - Insecure Temporary File

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A predictable temp file in a shared folder can be pre-created or replaced by another app.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
File("/sdcard/tmp_" + id)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
File.createTempFile("tmp_", ".bin", cacheDir)   // app-private cache
```

#### CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = true
<provider android:exported="true" android:grantUriPermissions="true" ... />   <!-- every path can be handed out -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = false
webSettings.allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs = false
<provider android:exported="false" android:grantUriPermissions="false" ...>
    <grant-uri-permission android:pathPrefix="/shared/" />   <!-- only the paths that must be shared -->
</provider>
```

#### CWE-73 - External Control of File Name or Path

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri"); contentResolver.openInputStream(uri!!)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri")
if (uri?.scheme == "content" && uri.authority in ALLOWED_AUTHORITIES) contentResolver.openInputStream(uri)
```

#### CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("ping " + host)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// no shell: fixed program, arguments as separate list items, validated input
ProcessBuilder("ping", "-c", "1", validatedHost).redirectErrorStream(true).start()
// better: use an Android API instead of a command
```

#### CWE-524 - Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="text" />   <!-- password-like field with suggestions on -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword|textNoSuggestions" android:importantForAutofill="no" />
```

#### CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (Path Traversal)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val out = File(dir, entry.name)            // entry.name may contain ../
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val out = File(dir, entry.name).canonicalFile
if (!out.path.startsWith(dir.canonicalPath + File.separator)) throw SecurityException("bad path")
```

#### CWE-79 - Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Untrusted text placed into HTML inside a WebView runs as script in that page. With a JavaScript bridge or file access enabled it can reach app data or native methods.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webView.loadData("<h1>Hello " + userName + "</h1>", "text/html", "UTF-8")
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val safe = android.text.Html.escapeHtml(userName)   // or TextUtils.htmlEncode
webView.loadDataWithBaseURL(null, "<h1>Hello " + safe + "</h1>", "text/html", "UTF-8", null)
// plus: keep JavaScript off unless needed, no JS interface on untrusted pages
