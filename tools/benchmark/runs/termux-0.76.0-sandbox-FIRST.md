### Findings

#### 1. [CRITICAL] Debuggable build

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-489 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-RESILIENCE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-debuggable
- Priority: 90/100 (P1)
- Why flagged: android:debuggable="true" is set. Anyone with the APK (or USB access to the device) can attach a debugger, set breakpoints, dump memory, or step through the logic - including past client-side checks.
- Risk scenario: A debuggable app lets anyone attach a debugger, run code inside the process and read its private data; WebView debugging exposes pages and JS state over USB. android:testOnly marks a test build that may carry relaxed checks and must not be shipped.
- Fix: Remove android:debuggable, or make sure it is only true in debug build variants and never in what you ship/test for release.

#### 2. [LOW] No network security config referenced

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: manifest-network-security-config
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: No android:networkSecurityConfig is set. On devices running API < 28, cleartext HTTP is allowed by default unless a config says otherwise, so this app's real cleartext posture on older phones is unverified here.
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Add a network_security_config.xml with cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" as the base config (and certificate pinning if the app always talks to the same backend).

#### 3. [LOW] Exported activity-alias without a permission: com.termux.HomeActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered to LOW: exported by design (public entry action: MAIN).
- Why flagged: This activity-alias is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 4. [MEDIUM] Exported activity without a permission: com.termux.app.activities.SettingsActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 5. [LOW] Exported activity-alias without a permission: com.termux.app.api.file.FileViewReceiverActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered to LOW: exported by design (public entry action: VIEW).
- Why flagged: This activity-alias is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 6. [LOW] Exported activity-alias without a permission: com.termux.app.api.file.FileShareReceiverActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered to LOW: exported by design (public entry action: SEND).
- Why flagged: This activity-alias is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 7. [MEDIUM] Provider grants URI permissions broadly: com.termux.filepicker.TermuxDocumentsProvider

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: manifest-exported-provider-grant-uri
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: android:grantUriPermissions="true" on the whole provider lets any Intent that carries a content:// Uri of it hand temporary access to the receiving app, for every path of the provider.
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Limit it with <grant-uri-permission android:path/pathPrefix=...> to only the paths that must be shared, and check the FileProvider paths XML does not expose root-path or the whole external storage.

#### 8. [MEDIUM] Provider grants URI permissions broadly: com.termux.app.TermuxOpenReceiver$ContentProvider

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: manifest-exported-provider-grant-uri
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: android:grantUriPermissions="true" on the whole provider lets any Intent that carries a content:// Uri of it hand temporary access to the receiving app, for every path of the provider.
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Limit it with <grant-uri-permission android:path/pathPrefix=...> to only the paths that must be shared, and check the FileProvider paths XML does not expose root-path or the whole external storage.

#### 9. [MEDIUM] Powerful permissions requested (4)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-250 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-powerful-permissions
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: - MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: all-files access to shared storage
- SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW: draws over other apps (overlay / tapjacking / phishing UI)
- WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS: changes secure system settings
- REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES: can install other APKs
- Risk scenario: Extra privileges (debuggable, test-only, shared user id, legacy storage) widen what a compromise or a malicious app can reach. Powerful permissions (SMS, overlay, install packages) and an AccessibilityService give a compromised app, or overlay and banking malware, far more reach than the feature needs.
- Fix: Request only what the feature really needs, and prefer the narrower alternative (photo picker, SAF, SMS Retriever / User Consent API instead of READ_SMS).

#### 10. [LOW] Low minSdkVersion (21)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Confidence: LOW | Rule: manifest-min-sdk
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Supporting API < 23 (Android 6) means the app can run on devices without runtime permission prompts and with older TLS/cipher defaults.
- Fix: Raise minSdkVersion if the user base allows it; otherwise double check that sensitive permissions and network calls are still handled safely on the oldest supported devices.

#### 11. [LOW] Old targetSdkVersion (28)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Confidence: LOW | Rule: manifest-target-sdk
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app targets API 28, so Android keeps legacy behaviour for it, components with an intent-filter are exported by default and PendingIntents are mutable by default, and newer privacy / storage protections do not apply to it.
- Fix: Raise targetSdkVersion to a current API level and re-test; this is the cheapest way to get many OS-level protections.

#### 12. [LOW] sharedUserId set (com.termux)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-266 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-shared-user-id
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Apps signed with the same key that declare this sharedUserId run under one Linux UID: they can read each other's private files and share permissions, so one weak app weakens all of them. The attribute is deprecated since API 29.
- Risk scenario: A component or permission grants more than it needs, so a low-privileged caller can do high-privileged things. android:sharedUserId puts every app signed with the same key into one Linux UID, so the weakest of them exposes the private files and permissions of all the others.
- Fix: Remove sharedUserId and share data through explicit, permission-protected providers/services.

#### 13. [LOW] Legacy external storage requested

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-legacy-external-storage
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" opts out of scoped storage, so files the app writes to shared storage stay readable (and replaceable) by other apps that hold the storage permission.
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Migrate to scoped storage (MediaStore / SAF / getExternalFilesDir) and remove the flag.

#### 14. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `com.termux.app.event.SystemEventReceiver`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 109)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 15. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `com.termux.app.TermuxInstaller$2`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 154)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 16. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `com.termux.app.TermuxOpenReceiver$ContentProvider`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 230)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 17. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input is used as a file path

- Location: `com.termux.app.TermuxOpenReceiver$ContentProvider`
- CWE: CWE-22 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP
- Priority: 27/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Data from a ContentProvider method parameter (other apps can call it when the provider is exported) reaches ParcelFileDescriptor.open() in method openFile(): a file chosen by the caller is handed out as a descriptor. The value was followed through registers, fields and calls inside this class and no sanitizer was seen on the way. The method also contains validation-like calls (startsWith, matches, getHost, canonical path, allow-list contains ...): verify that they really restrict this value before the sink.  (around line 338)
- Risk scenario: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).
- Fix: Reduce the input to a bare file name (File(name).name), resolve it against a fixed directory, call canonicalFile and check it still starts with that directory.

#### 18. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input chooses the file or content URI the app opens

- Location: `com.termux.app.api.file.FileReceiverActivity`
- CWE: CWE-73 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getParcelableExtra() reaches ContentResolver.openInputStream() in method handleContentUri(): the caller picks the URI the app reads, so a file:// URI makes the app read its own private files. The value was followed through registers, fields and calls inside this class and no sanitizer was seen on the way. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field.  (around line 304)
- Risk scenario: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.
- Fix: Accept only the content:// authorities you expect (reject file:// and your own FileProvider/app-private paths) before opening a URI that came from an Intent; copy with a fixed name and cap the size.

#### 19. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input is used as a file path

- Location: `com.termux.app.api.file.FileReceiverActivity`
- CWE: CWE-22 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP
- Priority: 27/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getData() via UriUtils.getUriFilePathWithFragment() reaches FileInputStream.<init>() in method onResume(): a file chosen by the caller is read (../ reaches the app's private files). The value was followed through registers, fields and calls inside this class and no sanitizer was seen on the way. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field. The method also contains validation-like calls (startsWith, matches, getHost, canonical path, allow-list contains ...): verify that they really restrict this value before the sink.  (around line 930)
- Risk scenario: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).
- Fix: Reduce the input to a bare file name (File(name).name), resolve it against a fixed directory, call canonicalFile and check it still starts with that directory.

#### 20. [HIGH] Possible Zip Slip (unsanitized zip entry path)

- Location: `com.termux.app.TermuxInstaller$1`
- CWE: CWE-22 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: zip-slip | Scope: APP
- Priority: 60/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This method reads ZipEntry.getName() while extracting an archive and builds a File/output path from it, with no getCanonicalPath()/normalize() check anywhere in the method. A crafted entry name containing "../" segments can write outside the intended extraction directory (e.g. overwrite app files or drop an executable in a sensitive location).  (around line 312)
- Risk scenario: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).
- Fix: Resolve the destination file, call getCanonicalPath() on it, and verify it still starts with the intended output directory before writing; reject/skip any entry that fails the check.

#### 21. [LOW] PendingIntent without FLAG_IMMUTABLE

- Location: `com.termux.app.TermuxService`
- CWE: CWE-927 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: pendingintent-mutable | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A mutable PendingIntent can be filled in by another app that receives it (changing action/extras), and Android 12+ requires you to choose explicitly.  (around line 804)
- Risk scenario: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.
- Fix: Add PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE unless the receiver truly needs to modify it.

#### 22. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `com.termux.app.TermuxActivity`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 312)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 23. [MEDIUM] Broadcast sent without a receiver permission

- Location: `com.termux.app.TermuxActivity`
- CWE: CWE-927 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: broadcast-unprotected-send | Scope: APP
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This sendBroadcast() sends an Intent with no package, no component and no receiver permission, so ANY installed app that registers a receiver for the action "com.termux.app.reload_style" receives it (intent sniffing). It carries extras or data. Traced in SSA: the Intent is built in this method and never handed to another method before the call.  (around line 1164)
- Risk scenario: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.
- Fix: Use sendBroadcast(intent, permission) with a signature-level permission, or setPackage(getPackageName()) / an explicit component / LocalBroadcastManager. Never put credentials in a broadcast.

#### 24. [MEDIUM] Intent.parseUri (intent redirection)

- Location: `com.termux.am.IntentCmd`
- CWE: CWE-927 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: intent-parseuri | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Building an Intent from a string (often from a link/extra) lets an attacker choose the target component and extras; unchecked, this reaches non-exported components.  (around line 2332)
- Risk scenario: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.
- Fix: Parse with URI_INTENT_SCHEME, then clear the component/selector, and verify the target is allow-listed before startActivity.

#### 25. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `com.termux.app.activities.SettingsActivity$RootPreferencesFragment$2`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 129)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 26. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `com.termux.app.terminal.TermuxTerminalViewClient$2`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 252)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 27. [MEDIUM] Java deserialization (ObjectInputStream.readObject)

- Location: `com.termux.shared.file.FileUtils`
- CWE: CWE-502 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: deserialization | Scope: APP
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Deserializing data that an attacker can influence (file, socket, Intent extra) can instantiate arbitrary classes and run gadget chains.  (around line 5954)
- Risk scenario: A crafted serialized object can instantiate unexpected classes while it is read (gadget chains) and lead to code execution, denial of service or tampered state.
- Fix: Prefer a data format (JSON/Protobuf) with an explicit schema; if Serializable is required, use an ObjectInputFilter allow-list.

#### 28. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `com.termux.shared.termux.file.TermuxFileUtils`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 242)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 29. [LOW] PendingIntent without FLAG_IMMUTABLE (x2)

- Location: `com.termux.shared.termux.crash.TermuxCrashUtils`
- CWE: CWE-927 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: pendingintent-mutable | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A mutable PendingIntent can be filled in by another app that receives it (changing action/extras), and Android 12+ requires you to choose explicitly.  (around line 866)
- Risk scenario: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.
- Fix: Add PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE unless the receiver truly needs to modify it.

#### 30. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `com.termux.shared.termux.crash.TermuxCrashUtils`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 799)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 31. [LOW] PendingIntent without FLAG_IMMUTABLE (x2)

- Location: `com.termux.shared.termux.plugins.TermuxPluginUtils`
- CWE: CWE-927 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: pendingintent-mutable | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A mutable PendingIntent can be filled in by another app that receives it (changing action/extras), and Android 12+ requires you to choose explicitly.  (around line 1095)
- Risk scenario: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.
- Fix: Add PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE unless the receiver truly needs to modify it.

#### 32. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `com.termux.shared.termux.plugins.TermuxPluginUtils`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 1028)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 33. [MEDIUM] Shell command execution

- Location: `com.termux.shared.shell.command.runner.app.AppShell`
- CWE: CWE-78 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: shell-exec | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: The app runs an OS command via Runtime.exec/ProcessBuilder. If any part of that command comes from user input, an Intent extra, or a server response, this is a command-injection surface.  (around line 366)
- Risk scenario: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).
- Fix: Trace where the command string comes from; avoid building it from untrusted input, or use a fixed allow-list of arguments instead of a shell string.

#### 34. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `com.termux.shared.android.PermissionUtils`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 254)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 35. [MEDIUM] Shell command execution

- Location: `com.termux.shared.android.AndroidUtils`
- CWE: CWE-78 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: shell-exec | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: The app runs an OS command via Runtime.exec/ProcessBuilder. If any part of that command comes from user input, an Intent extra, or a server response, this is a command-injection surface.  (around line 1135)
- Risk scenario: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).
- Fix: Trace where the command string comes from; avoid building it from untrusted input, or use a fixed allow-list of arguments instead of a shell string.

#### 36. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `com.termux.shared.interact.ShareUtils`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 546)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 37. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `com.termux.shared.interact.ShareUtils`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 136)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 38. [LOW] Keyboard cache: sensitive input field (x2)

- Location: `res/layout/mtrl_picker_text_input_date.xml`
- CWE: CWE-524 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The field "(id not resolved)" looks sensitive or is the main input of this screen, but its inputType (0x14) does not disable suggestions. The keyboard may learn and cache what is typed (autocorrect dictionary, predictive text).  [res/layout/mtrl_picker_text_input_date.xml]  The same applies to 1 more layout(s): res/layout/mtrl_picker_text_input_date_range.xml.
- Risk scenario: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.
- Fix: Use android:inputType="textPassword" (or textNoSuggestions|textVisiblePassword) and consider importantForAutofill="no" for secrets.

#### 39. [CRITICAL] Untrusted input reaches a shell command

- Location: `com.termux.shared.shell.command.runner.app.AppShell`
- CWE: CWE-78 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP

Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field.
- Risk scenario: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).
- Fix: Do not build shell commands from input. Call an API instead, or pass fixed arguments and validate each one against an allow-list.

The chain also contains validation-like calls (startsWith, matches, getHost, canonical path, allow-list contains ...): verify that they really restrict this value before the sink. 2 flows of this kind end in this method.
- Risk scenario: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.
- Fix: Accept only the content:// authorities you expect (reject file:// and your own FileProvider/app-private paths) before opening a URI that came from an Intent; copy with a fixed name and cap the size.

### Remediation guide

One entry per weakness type found above.

#### CWE-489 - Active Debug Code

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-RESILIENCE

Risk: A debuggable app lets anyone attach a debugger, run code inside the process and read its private data; WebView debugging exposes pages and JS state over USB. android:testOnly marks a test build that may carry relaxed checks and must not be shipped.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:debuggable="true" android:testOnly="true" ...>
WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<!-- release builds are not debuggable by default: remove android:debuggable and android:testOnly -->
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true)
```

#### CWE-319 - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" ...>
val url = "http://api.example.com/login"   // plain HTTP
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true" />   <!-- every domain may use plain HTTP -->
</network-security-config>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="false" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" ...>
val url = "https://api.example.com/login"   // TLS
<!-- res/xml/network_security_config.xml -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" />
</network-security-config>
<!-- only if one legacy host really needs HTTP: scope it to that host, never to base-config -->
<domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
    <domain includeSubdomains="false">legacy.example.com</domain>
</domain-config>
```

#### CWE-926 - Improper Export of Android Application Components

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="true" />
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="normal" />   <!-- any app can request it -->
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" />   <!-- writes are open -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="false" />
<!-- if another app must call it: android:permission="com.example.PERM" with protectionLevel="signature", and validate every extra -->
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="signature" />
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" android:writePermission="com.example.WRITE" />
```

#### CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = true
<provider android:exported="true" android:grantUriPermissions="true" ... />   <!-- every path can be handed out -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = false
webSettings.allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs = false
<provider android:exported="false" android:grantUriPermissions="false" ...>
    <grant-uri-permission android:pathPrefix="/shared/" />   <!-- only the paths that must be shared -->
</provider>
```

#### CWE-250 - Execution with Unnecessary Privileges

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Extra privileges (debuggable, test-only, shared user id, legacy storage) widen what a compromise or a malicious app can reach. Powerful permissions (SMS, overlay, install packages) and an AccessibilityService give a compromised app, or overlay and banking malware, far more reach than the feature needs.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:debuggable="true" android:testOnly="true" ...>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS" />
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<!-- ship release builds without debuggable / testOnly; request only the permissions you use -->
<!-- OTP codes: SMS Retriever or SMS User Consent API instead of READ_SMS; files: photo picker or the Storage Access Framework -->
```

#### CWE-266 - Incorrect Privilege Assignment

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: A component or permission grants more than it needs, so a low-privileged caller can do high-privileged things. android:sharedUserId puts every app signed with the same key into one Linux UID, so the weakest of them exposes the private files and permissions of all the others.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<manifest android:sharedUserId="com.example.shared" ...>
<provider android:exported="true" android:grantUriPermissions="true" ... />
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<!-- remove sharedUserId (deprecated since API 29); share data through explicit, permission-protected providers or services -->
<provider android:exported="false" android:grantUriPermissions="true" ... />   <!-- share single URIs on demand -->
```

#### CWE-922 - Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "export.json").writeText(json)
<application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
File(filesDir, "export.json").writeText(json)          // app-private storage
// to share: use a FileProvider with a narrow path and grant temporary URI permission
// scoped storage: remove requestLegacyExternalStorage; use MediaStore, the Storage Access Framework or getExternalFilesDir
```

#### CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (Path Traversal)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val out = File(dir, entry.name)            // entry.name may contain ../
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val out = File(dir, entry.name).canonicalFile
if (!out.path.startsWith(dir.canonicalPath + File.separator)) throw SecurityException("bad path")
```

#### CWE-73 - External Control of File Name or Path

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri"); contentResolver.openInputStream(uri!!)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri")
if (uri?.scheme == "content" && uri.authority in ALLOWED_AUTHORITIES) contentResolver.openInputStream(uri)

#### CWE-927 - Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.example.TOKEN").putExtra("token", t))
PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, 0)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.example.TOKEN").setPackage(packageName).putExtra("token", t))
PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE)
```

#### CWE-502 - Deserialization of Untrusted Data

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: A crafted serialized object can instantiate unexpected classes while it is read (gadget chains) and lead to code execution, denial of service or tampered state.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val obj = ObjectInputStream(input).readObject()
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// use a data-only format with a schema (JSON / Protobuf) and validate every field
val dto = Json.decodeFromString<Message>(text)
// if Java serialization is unavoidable: set an ObjectInputFilter allow-list
```

#### CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("ping " + host)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// no shell: fixed program, arguments as separate list items, validated input
ProcessBuilder("ping", "-c", "1", validatedHost).redirectErrorStream(true).start()
// better: use an Android API instead of a command
```

#### CWE-524 - Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="text" />   <!-- password-like field with suggestions on -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword|textNoSuggestions" android:importantForAutofill="no" />
```
