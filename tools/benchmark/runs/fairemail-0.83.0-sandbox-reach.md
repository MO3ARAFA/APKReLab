# APK ReLab report: eu.faircode.email

(sandbox scan, no AI triage)

## Security scan

Heuristic static scan - 407 finding(s) in total; 122 listed below (app/unknown code; INFO and known-library findings left out). Findings are leads: verify manually before relying on any of this.

Not covered by this scan: business-logic flaws (prices, limits, order flows), server-side bugs of the APIs the app calls, and native (C/C++) code; a large app is analysed in groups, so a data flow that crosses groups can be missed.

### Findings

#### 1. [MEDIUM] Backup allowed (allowBackup)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-530 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-allow-backup
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: android:allowBackup is not explicitly "false" (it defaults to true). Via `adb backup` (no root needed on many OS versions) or a cloud backup, the app's private data - databases, SharedPreferences, saved tokens - can be extracted.
- Risk scenario: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.
- Fix: Set android:allowBackup="false", or if backups are wanted, add a dataExtractionRules/fullBackupContent file that explicitly excludes anything sensitive.

#### 2. [MEDIUM] Deep link entry point: eu.faircode.email.ActivitySearch

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-939 | OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: manifest-deep-links
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: This activity can be opened from a browser/other apps via eu.faircode.email.search://. Anything in the link (path, query, fragment) is attacker-controlled input, and a custom scheme with no host can be claimed by any other installed app (link hijacking).
- Risk scenario: Any web page or app can fire the deep link. If the handler acts on its parameters (open URL, log in, pay) without checking them, the link becomes a remote control for the app.
- Fix: Validate every parameter taken from the incoming Intent data (host allow-list, type checks), never load it into a WebView or use it as a file path unchecked; for web links use verified App Links (autoVerify + assetlinks.json).

#### 3. [MEDIUM] Deep link entry point: eu.faircode.email.ActivityCompose

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-939 | OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: manifest-deep-links
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: This activity can be opened from a browser/other apps via mailto://. Anything in the link (path, query, fragment) is attacker-controlled input, and a custom scheme with no host can be claimed by any other installed app (link hijacking).
- Risk scenario: Any web page or app can fire the deep link. If the handler acts on its parameters (open URL, log in, pay) without checking them, the link becomes a remote control for the app.
- Fix: Validate every parameter taken from the incoming Intent data (host allow-list, type checks), never load it into a WebView or use it as a file path unchecked; for web links use verified App Links (autoVerify + assetlinks.json).

#### 4. [MEDIUM] Deep link entry point: eu.faircode.email.ActivitySendSelf

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-939 | OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: manifest-deep-links
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: This activity can be opened from a browser/other apps via mailto://. Anything in the link (path, query, fragment) is attacker-controlled input, and a custom scheme with no host can be claimed by any other installed app (link hijacking).

#### 5. [LOW] Exported activity without a permission: eu.faircode.email.ActivityWidget

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered to LOW: exported by design (public entry action: APPWIDGET_CONFIGURE).
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 19. [LOW] Legacy external storage requested

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-legacy-external-storage
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" opts out of scoped storage, so files the app writes to shared storage stay readable (and replaceable) by other apps that hold the storage permission.
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Migrate to scoped storage (MediaStore / SAF / getExternalFilesDir) and remove the flag.

#### 20. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `biweekly.util.XmlUtils`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/property/accessExternalSchema) and 2 more in this class. Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 170)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 21. [LOW] Weak hash: SHA-1

- Location: `fl1`
- CWE: CWE-328 | OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: crypto-weak-hash | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: SHA-1 is deprecated for security use (collision attacks exist); not safe for certificates or signatures.  (around line 2343)
- Risk scenario: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.
- Fix: Use SHA-256 or better.

#### 22. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `eo`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://javax.xml.XMLConstants/property/accessExternalDTD) and 2 more in this class. Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 561)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 23. [LOW] Dynamic code loading

- Location: `s01`
- CWE: CWE-94 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: dynamic-code-loading | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 14/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered one level: heuristic finding inside obfuscated (likely third-party) code.
- Why flagged: The app loads code at runtime (DexClassLoader & co). If the dex/jar comes from a writable or downloaded location without integrity checks, an attacker can swap it and run code with the app's permissions.  (around line 2656)
- Risk scenario: Code loaded at runtime from a writable, downloaded or attacker-reachable location executes with the app's permissions, so replacing that file means running the attacker's code.
- Fix: Load code only from app-private, read-only storage, verify a signature/hash, or bundle it in the APK.

#### 24. [MEDIUM] Code loaded from another app's package context

- Location: `hu`
- CWE: CWE-94 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: package-context-code | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 33/100 (P3)
- Note: Lowered one level: heuristic finding inside obfuscated (likely third-party) code.
- Why flagged: createPackageContext() is called with CONTEXT_INCLUDE_CODE and the resulting context's class loader is used, and no signature check of the target package is visible. Any app installed under that package name runs its code inside this process.  (around line 3425)
- Risk scenario: Code loaded at runtime from a writable, downloaded or attacker-reachable location executes with the app's permissions, so replacing that file means running the attacker's code.
- Fix: Do not load code from other apps. If you must, verify the package signature with PackageManager.checkSignatures / signing certificates first and drop CONTEXT_IGNORE_SECURITY.

#### 25. [MEDIUM] Code loaded from another app's package context

- Location: `mx0`
- CWE: CWE-94 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: package-context-code | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 33/100 (P3)
- Note: Lowered one level: heuristic finding inside obfuscated (likely third-party) code.
- Why flagged: createPackageContext() is called with CONTEXT_INCLUDE_CODE and the resulting context's class loader is used, and no signature check of the target package is visible. Any app installed under that package name runs its code inside this process.  (around line 334)
- Risk scenario: Code loaded at runtime from a writable, downloaded or attacker-reachable location executes with the app's permissions, so replacing that file means running the attacker's code.
- Fix: Do not load code from other apps. If you must, verify the package signature with PackageManager.checkSignatures / signing certificates first and drop CONTEXT_IGNORE_SECURITY.

#### 26. [MEDIUM] Possible SQL built by string concatenation

- Location: `eu.faircode.email.DB`
- CWE: CWE-89 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: sql-concat | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: rawQuery/execSQL is called shortly after building a string with StringBuilder - a common pattern for SQL assembled from variables. If any part comes from outside input, it can be SQL-injectable.  (around line 13264)
- Risk scenario: Input such as ' OR '1'='1 changes the meaning of the query: an attacker (or another app calling an exported ContentProvider) can read other rows, bypass a login check or modify data.
- Fix: Use parameterized queries ('?' placeholders + selectionArgs) instead of concatenating values into the SQL text.

#### 27. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `eu.faircode.email.WebViewEx`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 2044)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 28. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `eu.faircode.email.EditTextMultiAutoComplete`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 1827)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 29. [LOW] Shared external storage used

- Location: `eu.faircode.email.DebugHelper`
- CWE: CWE-922 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: external-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Files on shared storage can be read (and before scoped storage, replaced) by other apps.  (around line 23755)
- Risk scenario: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.
- Fix: Keep sensitive data in internal storage (filesDir) or getExternalFilesDir with encryption.

#### 30. [MEDIUM] Shell command execution

- Location: `eu.faircode.email.DebugHelper`
- CWE: CWE-78 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: shell-exec | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: The app runs an OS command via Runtime.exec/ProcessBuilder. If any part of that command comes from user input, an Intent extra, or a server response, this is a command-injection surface.  (around line 11501)
- Risk scenario: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).
- Fix: Trace where the command string comes from; avoid building it from untrusted input, or use a fixed allow-list of arguments instead of a shell string.

#### 31. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `eu.faircode.email.DebugHelper`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://example.com/). Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 6853)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 32. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 152)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

- CWE: CWE-939 | OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: deeplink-host-validation | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: The host of a Uri is read and then compared with String.startsWith(). Checks like that accept hosts such as evil-example.com or example.com.evil.com, so a deep link can point the app (WebView, login, download) at an attacker's server.  (around line 414)
- Risk scenario: Any web page or app can fire the deep link. If the handler acts on its parameters (open URL, log in, pay) without checking them, the link becomes a remote control for the app.
- Fix: Compare the whole host with an allow-list using equals(), or require host == "example.com" || host.endsWith(".example.com") (note the leading dot) after parsing with a real URI parser.

#### 36. [MEDIUM] Sensitive value saved to SharedPreferences (plaintext)

- Location: `eu.faircode.email.FragmentOptionsBackup`
- CWE: CWE-312 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: putString() is called next to a credential-like name. SharedPreferences are stored as plain XML in the app's data directory; they are readable on rooted devices and in backups when allowBackup is on.  (around line 2134)
- Risk scenario: Anyone with the device in hand, a backup, a rooted phone or another app exploiting a file leak can read tokens, passwords or personal data stored in plain text.
- Fix: Do not store passwords/tokens in SharedPreferences. Use EncryptedSharedPreferences or the Android Keystore, and prefer short-lived tokens.

#### 37. [HIGH] Credential stored in plain SharedPreferences

- CWE: CWE-312 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: fintech-unencrypted-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 60/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: A value under the key "cloud_password" is written with SharedPreferences.Editor.putString(), and this class never touches EncryptedSharedPreferences or the Android Keystore. Plain SharedPreferences XML is readable on a rooted device, from an adb backup, or from any app sharing the same Linux UID (shared UID apps) - for a PIN, API key or session token that's a direct credential-theft path.  (around line 2146)
- Risk scenario: Anyone with the device in hand, a backup, a rooted phone or another app exploiting a file leak can read tokens, passwords or personal data stored in plain text.
- Fix: Move this key to androidx.security.crypto.EncryptedSharedPreferences, or better, keep it only in the Android Keystore (StrongBox/TEE-backed where available) and never serialize it to disk in cleartext.

- CWE: CWE-297 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: tls-hostname-verifier | Scope: APP
- Priority: 70/100 (P1)
- Why flagged: A HostnameVerifier that accepts every hostname (ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER, or a verify() that always returns a hardcoded true) is used - TLS stops confirming the server is who it claims to be.  (around line 35)
- Risk scenario: A valid certificate issued for ANY site is accepted for your server's name, so an attacker with a cheap certificate can sit between the app and the backend.
- Fix: Use the default HostnameVerifier, or a strict one that actually checks the certificate against the hostname.

#### 40. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `eu.faircode.email.FragmentOAuth`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url | Scope: APP

- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: authenticate(PromptInfo) is used without a CryptoObject, so the result is just a boolean callback. Anyone who can hook or patch the callback (Frida, smali patching) can fake a successful login.  (around line 812)
- Risk scenario: Authentication decisions made on the client can be bypassed by editing the app or replaying requests.
- Fix: Bind the biometric check to a Keystore key (setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)) and use authenticate(PromptInfo, CryptoObject), so the secret can only be unlocked by a real authentication.

- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 31277)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getParcelableArrayListExtra() reaches ContentResolver.openInputStream() in method processUri(): the caller picks the URI the app reads, so a file:// URI makes the app read its own private files. The value was followed through registers, fields and calls inside this class and no sanitizer was seen on the way. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field.  (around line 1149)
- Risk scenario: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.
- Fix: Accept only the content:// authorities you expect (reject file:// and your own FileProvider/app-private paths) before opening a URI that came from an Intent; copy with a fixed name and cap the size.

- Risk scenario: Any web page or app can fire the deep link. If the handler acts on its parameters (open URL, log in, pay) without checking them, the link becomes a remote control for the app.
- Fix: Compare the whole host with an allow-list using equals(), or require host == "example.com" || host.endsWith(".example.com") (note the leading dot) after parsing with a real URI parser.

- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 1442)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

- CWE: CWE-297 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: tls-hostname-verifier | Scope: APP
- Priority: 70/100 (P1)
- Why flagged: A HostnameVerifier that accepts every hostname (ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER, or a verify() that always returns a hardcoded true) is used - TLS stops confirming the server is who it claims to be.  (around line 35)
- Risk scenario: A valid certificate issued for ANY site is accepted for your server's name, so an attacker with a cheap certificate can sit between the app and the backend.
- Fix: Use the default HostnameVerifier, or a strict one that actually checks the certificate against the hostname.

- CWE: CWE-927 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: broadcast-unprotected-send | Scope: APP
- Priority: 70/100 (P1)
- Why flagged: This sendBroadcast() sends an Intent with no package, no component and no receiver permission, so ANY installed app that registers a receiver for the action "eu.faircode.email.NEW_MESSAGE_COUNT" receives it (intent sniffing). It carries extras or data. Traced in SSA: the Intent is built in this method and never handed to another method before the call.  (around line 497)
- Risk scenario: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.
- Fix: Use sendBroadcast(intent, permission) with a signature-level permission, or setPackage(getPackageName()) / an explicit component / LocalBroadcastManager. Never put credentials in a broadcast.

#### 68. [LOW] Untrusted input chooses the server the app contacts

- Location: `eu.faircode.email.OpenAI`
- CWE: CWE-918 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE / MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: LOW | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: Data from SharedPreferences.getString() (shared prefs are modifiable on rooted devices and in restored backups) reaches URL.<init>() in method call(): the caller picks the host the app connects to (internal services, attacker servers that receive the app's headers or tokens). The value was followed through registers, fields and calls inside this class and no sanitizer was seen on the way. The source is SharedPreferences, which only an attacker with root or a tampered backup can change: treat this as a lead, not as a confirmed flaw. The method also contains validation-like calls (startsWith, matches, getHost, canonical path, allow-list contains ...): verify that they really restrict this value before the sink.  (around line 196)
- Risk scenario: When a deep link, Intent extra or web page decides which host the app connects to, an attacker can point it at an internal service, a server that logs the app's headers and tokens, or a cleartext endpoint.
- Fix: Allow-list the host (and use https) before opening the connection; resolve a small id to a fixed URL on your side.

#### 69. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `eu.faircode.email.ApplicationEx`
- CWE: CWE-312 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: putString() is called next to a credential-like name. SharedPreferences are stored as plain XML in the app's data directory; they are readable on rooted devices and in backups when allowBackup is on.  (around line 5546)
- Risk scenario: Anyone with the device in hand, a backup, a rooted phone or another app exploiting a file leak can read tokens, passwords or personal data stored in plain text.
- Fix: Do not store passwords/tokens in SharedPreferences. Use EncryptedSharedPreferences or the Android Keystore, and prefer short-lived tokens.

#### 71. [MEDIUM] Secret token stored in plain SharedPreferences

- Location: `eu.faircode.email.ApplicationEx`
- CWE: CWE-312 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: fintech-unencrypted-storage | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: A value under the key "openai_apikey" is written with SharedPreferences.Editor.putString(), and this class never touches EncryptedSharedPreferences or the Android Keystore. Plain SharedPreferences XML is readable on a rooted device, from an adb backup, or from any app sharing the same Linux UID (shared UID apps) - for a PIN, API key or session token that's a direct credential-theft path.  (around line 5546)
- Risk scenario: Anyone with the device in hand, a backup, a rooted phone or another app exploiting a file leak can read tokens, passwords or personal data stored in plain text.
- Fix: Move this key to androidx.security.crypto.EncryptedSharedPreferences, or better, keep it only in the Android Keystore (StrongBox/TEE-backed where available) and never serialize it to disk in cleartext.

- CWE: CWE-939 | OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: deeplink-host-validation | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)

- Fix: Compare the whole host with an allow-list using equals(), or require host == "example.com" || host.endsWith(".example.com") (note the leading dot) after parsing with a real URI parser.

#### 75. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `eu.faircode.email.ActivityBilling`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 1247)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 76. [LOW] Shell command execution

- Location: `n4`
- CWE: CWE-78 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: shell-exec | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 14/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered one level: heuristic finding inside obfuscated (likely third-party) code.
- Why flagged: The app runs an OS command via Runtime.exec/ProcessBuilder. If any part of that command comes from user input, an Intent extra, or a server response, this is a command-injection surface.  (around line 363)
- Risk scenario: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).
- Fix: Trace where the command string comes from; avoid building it from untrusted input, or use a fixed allow-list of arguments instead of a shell string.

#### 77. [LOW] Native libraries not analysed (1 .so)

- Location: `lib/`
- Confidence: HIGH | Rule: native-coverage
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: This APK contains native libraries (libfairemail.so). APKReLab analyses Java / Kotlin (dex) code only: data handed to native methods is not followed.
- Fix: Review the native code separately (e.g. strings / imports of the .so, a disassembler) and check what the app passes to its JNI methods.

#### 78. [MEDIUM] Network Security Config: cleartext permitted

- Location: `res/8GD.xml`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: res-nsc-cleartext
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: network_security_config.xml allows plain HTTP (cleartextTrafficPermitted=true) in base-config, i.e. for every domain the app talks to. Traffic can be read and modified on the network (MASVS-NETWORK).  [res/8GD.xml]
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Set cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" in base-config and use HTTPS everywhere. If one legacy host really needs HTTP, allow it in a domain-config for that host only.

#### 79. [MEDIUM] Network Security Config: trusts user-installed CAs

- Location: `res/8GD.xml`
- CWE: CWE-295 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: res-nsc-user-ca
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: The config trusts certificates the user installed in: base-config (every domain). A proxy such as Burp/mitmproxy (or malware that installs a CA) can then decrypt this app's HTTPS traffic (MASVS-NETWORK).  [res/8GD.xml]
- Risk scenario: On a shared Wi-Fi or a hostile network the attacker presents any certificate and the app accepts it, so passwords, tokens and API traffic can be read and changed (man-in-the-middle). In network_security_config.xml the same thing happens by configuration: a certificates entry with src=user (or overridePins=true) makes the app trust CAs that the user or malware installed, so a proxy such as Burp or mitmproxy can decrypt the traffic of a normal release build. Without a pin-set, any certificate signed by a trusted CA is accepted for your backend.
- Fix: Trust only the system CAs (src="system") in release builds; keep user CAs inside <debug-overrides> only.

#### 80. [MEDIUM] Network Security Config: cleartext permitted

#### 82. [LOW] Keyboard cache: sensitive input field (x2)

- Location: `res/66t.xml`
- CWE: CWE-524 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The field "(id not resolved)" looks sensitive or is the main input of this screen, but its inputType (not set) does not disable suggestions. The keyboard may learn and cache what is typed (autocorrect dictionary, predictive text).  [res/66t.xml]  The same applies to 1 more layout(s): res/J7c.xml.
- Risk scenario: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.
- Fix: Use android:inputType="textPassword" (or textNoSuggestions|textVisiblePassword) and consider importantForAutofill="no" for secrets.

#### 83. [MEDIUM] Password screen not protected against tapjacking (x6)

- Location: `res/6xO.xml`
- CWE: CWE-1021 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: tapjacking-sensitive-layout
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: This layout has a password field ("?") and no view in it sets android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true", so a malicious overlay can sit on top of the screen and the field still receives the taps (tapjacking). No code mitigation (setFilterTouchesWhenObscured, onFilterTouchEventForSecurity, setHideOverlayWindows) is referenced anywhere in the app's dex. minSdkVersion is 23: devices below Android 12 do not block touches through overlays.  [res/6xO.xml]  The same applies to 5 more layout(s): res/ArV.xml, res/K5J.xml, res/PEq.xml, res/QU1.xml, res/WQR.xml.
- Risk scenario: A malicious app draws a transparent or misleading overlay on top of a login or payment screen; the user's taps go through to the real buttons or the overlay captures what is typed.
- Fix: Set android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true" on the root of this layout (or call setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(true) on it / getWindow().setHideOverlayWindows(true) on API 31+ in the Activity).

Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value travels through 3 methods. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field. The value passed an Object-typed field of an obfuscated class: R8 may have merged unrelated classes into one shared field there, so this flow can be a false positive (low confidence); check the chain before trusting it. The same input, read in SimpleTask$2$1.deliver()V, also reaches this kind of API in: WebViewEx.loadDataWithBaseURL(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V (one root cause, one card).
- Risk scenario: Untrusted text placed into HTML inside a WebView runs as script in that page. With a JavaScript bridge or file access enabled it can reach app data or native methods.
- Fix: Allow-list the scheme and host before loading (https and your own domains only), or map a small id to a fixed URL. Never pass an Intent extra straight to the WebView.

Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. The value travels through 2 methods. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field. The chain also contains validation-like calls (startsWith, matches, getHost, canonical path, allow-list contains ...): verify that they really restrict this value before the sink. 2 flows of this kind end in this method.  Also matched by: taint-flow (merged).
- Risk scenario: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).
- Fix: Reduce the input to a bare file name (File(name).name), resolve it against a fixed directory, call canonicalFile and check it still starts with that directory.

#### 86. [MEDIUM] Untrusted Intent is launched by this app (intent redirection)

- Risk scenario: An Intent object received from another app is launched as it is, so the attacker chooses which component runs (even a non-exported one) with this app's identity, permissions and URI grants.
- Fix: Do not launch an Intent you received from a caller. Build a new Intent for a fixed component of your own and copy over only the extras you need, or check getComponent() / getPackage() against an allow-list and clear the URI-permission flags before launching.

#### CWE-530 - Exposure of Backup File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="false" android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules" ...>

#### CWE-939 - Improper Authorization in Handler for Custom URL Scheme

OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Any web page or app can fire the deep link. If the handler acts on its parameters (open URL, log in, pay) without checking them, the link becomes a remote control for the app.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val target = intent.data?.getQueryParameter("redirect"); webView.loadUrl(target!!)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val target = intent.data?.getQueryParameter("redirect")?.let(Uri::parse)
if (target?.host == "app.example.com") open(target)     // allow-list; require user confirmation for sensitive actions
// prefer verified App Links (https + assetlinks.json) over custom schemes
```

#### CWE-926 - Improper Export of Android Application Components

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="true" />
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="normal" />   <!-- any app can request it -->
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" />   <!-- writes are open -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="false" />
<!-- if another app must call it: android:permission="com.example.PERM" with protectionLevel="signature", and validate every extra -->
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="signature" />
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" android:writePermission="com.example.WRITE" />
```

#### CWE-922 - Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: Data in shared/external storage or world-accessible files can be read (or replaced) by other apps and by anyone who connects the phone. requestLegacyExternalStorage opts out of scoped storage and keeps that exposure on Android 10 and later.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "export.json").writeText(json)
<application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
File(filesDir, "export.json").writeText(json)          // app-private storage
// to share: use a FileProvider with a narrow path and grant temporary URI permission
// scoped storage: remove requestLegacyExternalStorage; use MediaStore, the Storage Access Framework or getExternalFilesDir
```

#### CWE-319 - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" ...>
val url = "http://api.example.com/login"   // plain HTTP
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true" />   <!-- every domain may use plain HTTP -->
</network-security-config>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="false" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" ...>
val url = "https://api.example.com/login"   // TLS
<!-- res/xml/network_security_config.xml -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" />
</network-security-config>
<!-- only if one legacy host really needs HTTP: scope it to that host, never to base-config -->
<domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
    <domain includeSubdomains="false">legacy.example.com</domain>
</domain-config>
```

#### CWE-328 - Use of Weak Hash

OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO

Risk: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-1").digest(data)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256").digest(data)
// passwords: use a slow KDF (PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 with 600000+ iterations, Argon2id, scrypt)
```

#### CWE-94 - Improper Control of Generation of Code (Code Injection)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: Code loaded at runtime from a writable, downloaded or attacker-reachable location executes with the app's permissions, so replacing that file means running the attacker's code.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
DexClassLoader(File(getExternalFilesDir(null), "plugin.dex").path, optDir, null, classLoader)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// ship the code in the APK, or download it over HTTPS, verify a signature, and keep it in app-private storage (read-only after verification)
val f = File(filesDir, "plugin.dex"); verifySignature(f); f.setReadOnly()
```

#### CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (SQL Injection)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-CODE

Risk: Input such as ' OR '1'='1 changes the meaning of the query: an attacker (or another app calling an exported ContentProvider) can read other rows, bypass a login check or modify data.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + name + "'", null)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?", arrayOf(name))   // bound parameter
// ContentProvider.query: pass selection with ? and selectionArgs, never concatenate them
```

#### CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = true
<provider android:exported="true" android:grantUriPermissions="true" ... />   <!-- every path can be handed out -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = false
webSettings.allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs = false
<provider android:exported="false" android:grantUriPermissions="false" ...>
    <grant-uri-permission android:pathPrefix="/shared/" />   <!-- only the paths that must be shared -->
</provider>
```

#### CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: If any part of the command text is attacker-influenced, extra commands can be appended and run with the app's privileges (or root on a rooted device).

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("ping " + host)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// no shell: fixed program, arguments as separate list items, validated input
ProcessBuilder("ping", "-c", "1", validatedHost).redirectErrorStream(true).start()
// better: use an Android API instead of a command
```

#### CWE-312 - Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: Anyone with the device in hand, a backup, a rooted phone or another app exploiting a file leak can read tokens, passwords or personal data stored in plain text.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
prefs.edit().putString("password", password).apply()
db.execSQL("INSERT INTO users(pin) VALUES ('" + pin + "')")
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// store a token (not the password) and encrypt it with a Keystore-backed AES-GCM key
val sealed = keystoreCipher.encrypt(token.toByteArray())     // see CWE-321 sample for the key
prefs.edit().putString("token", Base64.encodeToString(sealed, Base64.NO_WRAP)).apply()
// database: SQLCipher or per-field encryption; never keep the password itself
```

#### CWE-297 - Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: A valid certificate issued for ANY site is accepted for your server's name, so an attacker with a cheap certificate can sit between the app and the backend.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier { _, _ -> true }
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// keep the default HostnameVerifier; if you must check, compare the real host
HostnameVerifier { host, session -> host == "api.example.com" && HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier().verify(host, session) }
```

#### CWE-287 - Improper Authentication

OWASP: M3 Insecure Authentication/Authorization | MASVS: MASVS-AUTH

Risk: Authentication decisions made on the client can be bypassed by editing the app or replaying requests.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
if (pin == "1234") unlock()
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// verify credentials on the server and use short-lived tokens
val ok = api.verifyPin(pinHash)
```

#### CWE-73 - External Control of File Name or Path

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri"); contentResolver.openInputStream(uri!!)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri")
if (uri?.scheme == "content" && uri.authority in ALLOWED_AUTHORITIES) contentResolver.openInputStream(uri)
```

#### CWE-918 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE / MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: When a deep link, Intent extra or web page decides which host the app connects to, an attacker can point it at an internal service, a server that logs the app's headers and tokens, or a cleartext endpoint.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val url = intent.getStringExtra("endpoint")
val conn = URL(url).openConnection()      // host chosen by the caller
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val id = intent.getStringExtra("endpoint")
val url = ENDPOINTS[id] ?: return          // fixed allow-list, https only
val conn = URL(url).openConnection()
```

#### CWE-927 - Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.example.TOKEN").putExtra("token", t))
PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, 0)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.example.TOKEN").setPackage(packageName).putExtra("token", t))
PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE)
```

#### CWE-295 - Improper Certificate Validation

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: On a shared Wi-Fi or a hostile network the attacker presents any certificate and the app accepts it, so passwords, tokens and API traffic can be read and changed (man-in-the-middle). In network_security_config.xml the same thing happens by configuration: a certificates entry with src=user (or overridePins=true) makes the app trust CAs that the user or malware installed, so a proxy such as Burp or mitmproxy can decrypt the traffic of a normal release build. Without a pin-set, any certificate signed by a trusted CA is accepted for your backend.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
object : X509TrustManager {
    override fun checkServerTrusted(c: Array<X509Certificate>, a: String) { }   // accepts everything
    override fun checkClientTrusted(c: Array<X509Certificate>, a: String) { }
    override fun getAcceptedIssuers() = arrayOf<X509Certificate>()
}
<!-- res/xml/network_security_config.xml: trusts any CA the user (or malware) installed -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config>
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="system" />
            <certificates src="user" />
        </trust-anchors>
    </base-config>
</network-security-config>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// use the platform trust store (do not override TrustManager at all)
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .certificatePinner(CertificatePinner.Builder()
        .add("api.example.com", "sha256/AAAA...=")      // optional: pin to your own backend
        .build())
    .build()
// WebView: in onReceivedSslError call handler.cancel(), never handler.proceed()

#### CWE-524 - Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="text" />   <!-- password-like field with suggestions on -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword|textNoSuggestions" android:importantForAutofill="no" />
```

#### CWE-1021 - Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames (Tapjacking)

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: A malicious app draws a transparent or misleading overlay on top of a login or payment screen; the user's taps go through to the real buttons or the overlay captures what is typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword" ... />   <!-- no filterTouchesWhenObscured -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<LinearLayout android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true" ...>
// or, API 31+: window.setHideOverlayWindows(true)  (needs HIDE_OVERLAY_WINDOWS)

#### CWE-79 - Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Untrusted text placed into HTML inside a WebView runs as script in that page. With a JavaScript bridge or file access enabled it can reach app data or native methods.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webView.loadData("<h1>Hello " + userName + "</h1>", "text/html", "UTF-8")
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val safe = android.text.Html.escapeHtml(userName)   // or TextUtils.htmlEncode
webView.loadDataWithBaseURL(null, "<h1>Hello " + safe + "</h1>", "text/html", "UTF-8", null)
// plus: keep JavaScript off unless needed, no JS interface on untrusted pages
```

#### CWE-22 - Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (Path Traversal)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A name such as ../../databases/app.db escapes the intended folder, so an exported provider or a zip entry can read or overwrite the app's private files (Zip Slip).

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val out = File(dir, entry.name)            // entry.name may contain ../
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val out = File(dir, entry.name).canonicalFile
if (!out.path.startsWith(dir.canonicalPath + File.separator)) throw SecurityException("bad path")
```

#### CWE-940 - Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel (Intent Redirection)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: An Intent object received from another app is launched as it is, so the attacker chooses which component runs (even a non-exported one) with this app's identity, permissions and URI grants.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val next = intent.getParcelableExtra<Intent>("extra_intent"); startActivity(next)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val next = intent.getParcelableExtra<Intent>("extra_intent")
val ok = next?.component?.packageName == packageName && next.component?.className in ALLOWED_SCREENS
if (ok) startActivity(Intent(this, Class.forName(next!!.component!!.className))) else finish()
