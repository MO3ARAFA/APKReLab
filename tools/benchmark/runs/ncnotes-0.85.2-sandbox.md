# APK ReLab report: it.niedermann.owncloud.notes

(sandbox scan, no AI triage)

## Security scan

Heuristic static scan - 586 finding(s) in total; 35 listed below (app/unknown code; INFO and known-library findings left out). Findings are leads: verify manually before relying on any of this.

Not covered by this scan: business-logic flaws (prices, limits, order flows), server-side bugs of the APIs the app calls, and native (C/C++) code; a large app is analysed in groups, so a data flow that crosses groups can be missed.

### Findings

#### 1. [MEDIUM] Backup allowed (allowBackup)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-530 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-allow-backup
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: android:allowBackup is not explicitly "false" (it defaults to true). Via `adb backup` (no root needed on many OS versions) or a cloud backup, the app's private data - databases, SharedPreferences, saved tokens - can be extracted.
- Risk scenario: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.
- Fix: Set android:allowBackup="false", or if backups are wanted, add a dataExtractionRules/fullBackupContent file that explicitly excludes anything sensitive.

#### 2. [MEDIUM] Cleartext (plain HTTP) traffic allowed

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-cleartext-traffic
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" lets the app make plain HTTP requests. Anyone sharing the network (public Wi-Fi, a compromised router) can read or tamper with that traffic.
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Set usesCleartextTraffic to "false" and use HTTPS everywhere; if a few hosts genuinely need HTTP, scope that with a network security config instead of a blanket allow.

#### 3. [LOW] Exported activity without a permission: it.niedermann.owncloud.notes.AppendToNoteActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Note: Lowered to LOW: exported by design (public entry action: SEND).
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 4. [MEDIUM] Exported activity without a permission: it.niedermann.owncloud.notes.edit.EditNoteActivity

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-exported-components
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: This activity is exported (usable by other apps) and declares no android:permission. Any other app on the device can start it directly (e.g. to jump past a login screen, trigger a broadcast handler, or bind a service) unless the component itself double-checks the caller.
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Add android:permission="..." (a signature-level permission for same-app-only access is often right), or set android:exported="false" if other apps never need to use it.

#### 5. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `it.niedermann.owncloud.notes.shared.util.clipboard.ClipboardUtil`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 162)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 6. [MEDIUM] WebView addJavascriptInterface

- Location: `it.niedermann.owncloud.notes.edit.NoteDirectEditFragment`
- CWE: CWE-749 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: webview-js-interface | Scope: APP
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: A Java/Kotlin object is bridged into a WebView's JavaScript context. Any page the WebView loads - including one reached via a hijacked link or a MITM'd connection - can call that object's @JavascriptInterface methods. The bridge object is another class: its @JavascriptInterface methods are judged there ("JavaScript-exposed method" findings).  (around line 1380)
- Risk scenario: Every page the WebView loads (including injected ads or a hijacked link) can call the exposed @JavascriptInterface methods, for example to read files, tokens or start activities.
- Fix: Avoid exposing a JS interface to untrusted pages; restrict it to known HTTPS origins, or use WebMessageListener on modern APIs instead.

#### 7. [LOW] PendingIntent without FLAG_IMMUTABLE

- Location: `it.niedermann.owncloud.notes.widget.singlenote.SingleNoteWidget`
- CWE: CWE-927 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: pendingintent-mutable | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A mutable PendingIntent can be filled in by another app that receives it (changing action/extras), and Android 12+ requires you to choose explicitly.  (around line 137)
- Risk scenario: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.
- Fix: Add PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE unless the receiver truly needs to modify it.

#### 8. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `it.niedermann.android.util.ClipboardUtil`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 109)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 9. [MEDIUM] Insecure TLS protocol requested: "TLSV1"

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.common.network.NetworkUtils`
- CWE: CWE-327 | OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: tls-protocol-version
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: SSLContext.getInstance("TLSV1") is used. "TLSV1" pins an old protocol version (TLSv1/TLSv1.1 are deprecated and disabled by many servers as of 2021).  (around line 409)
- Risk scenario: A network attacker can push the connection down to SSLv3 / TLSv1.0 / TLSv1.1, which have known attacks, and read or change the traffic.
- Fix: Use SSLContext.getInstance("TLSv1.3") (fall back to "TLSv1.2" only if you must support very old peers), or omit explicit protocol selection and rely on the platform default on modern API levels.

#### 10. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `com.nextcloud.android.sso.helper.Retrofit2Helper$1`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://example.com). Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 159)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 11. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `at.bitfire.dav4jvm.property.caldav.CalDAV`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url | Scope: OBF
- Priority: 17/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://apple.com/ns/ical/) and 1 more in this class. Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 325)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 12. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.common.network.WebdavEntry`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://owncloud.org/ns) and 5 more in this class. Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 490)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 13. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.common.network.WebdavUtils`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://owncloud.org/ns) and 8 more in this class. Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 142)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 14. [MEDIUM] Hardcoded sensitive field: PRIVATE_KEY

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.resources.users.StorePrivateKeyRemoteOperation`
- CWE: CWE-798 | OWASP: M1 Improper Credential Usage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: secrets-sensitive-fields
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: A field named like a credential is initialised with a fixed secret-looking string ("pri…", 10 chars), so it is baked into the APK and readable after decompiling.  (around line 23)
- Risk scenario: Anyone can unzip the APK (or run strings on the dex) and read the key, token or password. A leaked cloud/API key lets the attacker call the backend as the app, run up the bill, or read other users' data. Removing it in the next release does not help: old APKs stay in the wild, so the key must be rotated. Resources are no hiding place: res/values/strings.xml is compiled into resources.arsc, and apktool or a plain unzip shows every string. Tokens (JWT) can be decoded by anyone, and a Google / Firebase API key is only safe when it is restricted to your app.
- Fix: Load this from a secure backend at runtime, or store it via the Android Keystore - don't compile it into the APK.

#### 15. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.resources.files.LinkLivePhotoRemoteOperation`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://nextcloud.org/ns). Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 119)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 16. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.resources.files.ToggleFavoriteRemoteOperation`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://owncloud.org/ns). Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 46)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 17. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.resources.files.NcSearchMethod`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://owncloud.org/ns) and 2 more in this class. Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 236)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 18. [MEDIUM] Weak hash: MD5

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.resources.files.FileUtils`
- CWE: CWE-328 | OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: crypto-weak-hash
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: MD5 is broken for integrity/signature purposes (practical collisions); fine only as a non-security checksum.  (around line 120)
- Risk scenario: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.
- Fix: Use SHA-256+ for integrity; for passwords use a salted KDF (PBKDF2/bcrypt/Argon2), never a raw hash.

#### 19. [MEDIUM] Hardcoded sensitive field: PUSH_TOKEN

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.resources.notifications.RegisterAccountDeviceForProxyOperation`
- CWE: CWE-798 | OWASP: M1 Improper Credential Usage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-CRYPTO | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: secrets-sensitive-fields
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: A field named like a credential is initialised with a fixed secret-looking string ("pus…", 9 chars), so it is baked into the APK and readable after decompiling.  (around line 13)
- Risk scenario: Anyone can unzip the APK (or run strings on the dex) and read the key, token or password. A leaked cloud/API key lets the attacker call the backend as the app, run up the bill, or read other users' data. Removing it in the next release does not help: old APKs stay in the wild, so the key must be rotated. Resources are no hiding place: res/values/strings.xml is compiled into resources.arsc, and apktool or a plain unzip shows every string.

- Fix: Load this from a secure backend at runtime, or store it via the Android Keystore - don't compile it into the APK.

#### 20. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.resources.albums.ToggleAlbumFavoriteRemoteOperation`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://owncloud.org/ns). Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 192)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 21. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.resources.albums.PhotoAlbumEntry`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://nextcloud.org/ns). Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 125)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 22. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.resources.albums.PublicShareLinkAlbumRemoteOperation`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://nextcloud.org/ns). Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 230)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 23. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.resources.comments.MarkCommentsAsReadRemoteOperation`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://owncloud.org/ns). Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 45)
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 24. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `com.owncloud.android.lib.resources.tags.GetTagsRemoteOperation`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://owncloud.org/ns) and 1 more in this class. Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 113)

#### 25. [LOW] Hardcoded cleartext URL

- Location: `com.nextcloud.android.lib.resources.files.GetFilesDownloadLimitRemoteOperation`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: cleartext-url
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: A plain http:// URL is hardcoded (http://nextcloud.org/ns). Traffic to it can be read or modified on the network.  (around line 203)

- Fix: Switch to https:// (and make sure the server supports it).

#### 26. [MEDIUM] Java deserialization (ObjectInputStream.readObject)

- Location: `com.nextcloud.android.sso.model.SingleSignOnAccount`
- CWE: CWE-502 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: deserialization
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Deserializing data that an attacker can influence (file, socket, Intent extra) can instantiate arbitrary classes and run gadget chains.  (around line 76)
- Risk scenario: A crafted serialized object can instantiate unexpected classes while it is read (gadget chains) and lead to code execution, denial of service or tampered state.
- Fix: Prefer a data format (JSON/Protobuf) with an explicit schema; if Serializable is required, use an ObjectInputFilter allow-list.

#### 27. [MEDIUM] Java deserialization (ObjectInputStream.readObject)

- Location: `com.nextcloud.android.sso.api.AidlNetworkRequest$PlainHeader`
- CWE: CWE-502 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: deserialization
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Deserializing data that an attacker can influence (file, socket, Intent extra) can instantiate arbitrary classes and run gadget chains.  (around line 52)
- Risk scenario: A crafted serialized object can instantiate unexpected classes while it is read (gadget chains) and lead to code execution, denial of service or tampered state.
- Fix: Prefer a data format (JSON/Protobuf) with an explicit schema; if Serializable is required, use an ObjectInputFilter allow-list.

#### 28. [MEDIUM] Java deserialization (ObjectInputStream.readObject)

- Location: `com.nextcloud.android.sso.api.AidlNetworkRequest`
- CWE: CWE-502 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: deserialization
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Deserializing data that an attacker can influence (file, socket, Intent extra) can instantiate arbitrary classes and run gadget chains.  (around line 112)
- Risk scenario: A crafted serialized object can instantiate unexpected classes while it is read (gadget chains) and lead to code execution, denial of service or tampered state.
- Fix: Prefer a data format (JSON/Protobuf) with an explicit schema; if Serializable is required, use an ObjectInputFilter allow-list.

#### 29. [LOW] Native libraries not analysed (1 .so)

- Location: `lib/`
- Confidence: HIGH | Rule: native-coverage
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: This APK contains native libraries (libandroidx.graphics.path.so). APKReLab analyses Java / Kotlin (dex) code only: data handed to native methods is not followed.
- Fix: Review the native code separately (e.g. strings / imports of the .so, a disassembler) and check what the app passes to its JNI methods.

#### 30. [MEDIUM] Network Security Config: cleartext permitted

- Location: `res/8G.xml`
- CWE: CWE-319 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: res-nsc-cleartext
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: network_security_config.xml allows plain HTTP (cleartextTrafficPermitted=true) in base-config, i.e. for every domain the app talks to. Traffic can be read and modified on the network (MASVS-NETWORK).  [res/8G.xml]
- Risk scenario: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.
- Fix: Set cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" in base-config and use HTTPS everywhere. If one legacy host really needs HTTP, allow it in a domain-config for that host only.

#### 31. [MEDIUM] Network Security Config: trusts user-installed CAs

- Location: `res/8G.xml`
- CWE: CWE-295 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: res-nsc-user-ca
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: The config trusts certificates the user installed in: base-config (every domain). A proxy such as Burp/mitmproxy (or malware that installs a CA) can then decrypt this app's HTTPS traffic (MASVS-NETWORK).  [res/8G.xml]
- Risk scenario: On a shared Wi-Fi or a hostile network the attacker presents any certificate and the app accepts it, so passwords, tokens and API traffic can be read and changed (man-in-the-middle). In network_security_config.xml the same thing happens by configuration: a certificates entry with src=user (or overridePins=true) makes the app trust CAs that the user or malware installed, so a proxy such as Burp or mitmproxy can decrypt the traffic of a normal release build. Without a pin-set, any certificate signed by a trusted CA is accepted for your backend.
- Fix: Trust only the system CAs (src="system") in release builds; keep user CAs inside <debug-overrides> only.

#### 32. [LOW] Keyboard cache: sensitive input field

- Location: `res/66.xml`
- CWE: CWE-524 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The field "(id not resolved)" looks sensitive or is the main input of this screen, but its inputType (not set) does not disable suggestions. The keyboard may learn and cache what is typed (autocorrect dictionary, predictive text).  [res/66.xml]
- Risk scenario: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.
- Fix: Use android:inputType="textPassword" (or textNoSuggestions|textVisiblePassword) and consider importantForAutofill="no" for secrets.

#### 33. [MEDIUM] Password screen not protected against tapjacking (x2)

- Location: `res/LO.xml`
- CWE: CWE-1021 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: tapjacking-sensitive-layout
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: This layout has a password field ("@0x7f0902b3") and no view in it sets android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true", so a malicious overlay can sit on top of the screen and the field still receives the taps (tapjacking). No code mitigation (setFilterTouchesWhenObscured, onFilterTouchEventForSecurity, setHideOverlayWindows) is referenced anywhere in the app's dex. minSdkVersion is 28: devices below Android 12 do not block touches through overlays.  [res/LO.xml]  The same applies to 1 more layout(s): res/U6.xml.
- Risk scenario: A malicious app draws a transparent or misleading overlay on top of a login or payment screen; the user's taps go through to the real buttons or the overlay captures what is typed.
- Fix: Set android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true" on the root of this layout (or call setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(true) on it / getWindow().setHideOverlayWindows(true) on API 31+ in the Activity).

#### 34. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input chooses the file or content URI the app opens

- Location: `it.niedermann.owncloud.notes.edit.EditNoteActivity`
- CWE: CWE-73 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP | Reachable from an exported component
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getData() reaches ContentResolver.openInputStream() in method EditNoteActivity.launchReadonlyNote()V. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field.  Also matched by: taint-flow (merged).
- Risk scenario: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.
- Fix: Accept only the content:// authorities you expect (reject file:// and your own FileProvider/app-private paths) before opening a URI that came from an Intent; copy with a fixed name and cap the size.

#### 35. [MEDIUM] Untrusted input chooses the server the app contacts

- Location: `it.niedermann.owncloud.notes.shared.util.ShareUtil`
- CWE: CWE-918 | OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE / MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: taint-flow | Scope: APP | Reachable from an exported component
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: Data from Intent.getStringExtra() reaches URL.<init>() in method ShareUtil.extractSharedText(Landroid/content/Intent;)Ljava/lang/String;. Found by the SSA data-flow engine, which follows values through registers, fields and calls between methods and classes and keeps reused registers apart; no sanitizer was seen on the way. An Intent is controlled by the caller when the component is exported or opened through a deep link; check the manifest and the reachability field.  Also matched by: taint-flow (merged).
- Risk scenario: When a deep link, Intent extra or web page decides which host the app connects to, an attacker can point it at an internal service, a server that logs the app's headers and tokens, or a cleartext endpoint.
- Fix: Allow-list the host (and use https) before opening the connection; resolve a small id to a fixed URL on your side.

#### CWE-530 - Exposure of Backup File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="false" android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules" ...>
<!-- or keep backup and exclude secrets with fullBackupContent / dataExtractionRules -->
```

#### CWE-319 - Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: Plain HTTP can be read and modified by anyone on the path (Wi-Fi owner, ISP, rogue hotspot): session cookies, credentials and downloaded code or config can be stolen or replaced. Without a network security config, devices below API 28 allow cleartext by default. cleartextTrafficPermitted=true in base-config opens every domain; in a domain-config it opens that host only, which is smaller but still readable by anyone on the path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" ...>
val url = "http://api.example.com/login"   // plain HTTP
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true" />   <!-- every domain may use plain HTTP -->
</network-security-config>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="false" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" ...>
val url = "https://api.example.com/login"   // TLS
<!-- res/xml/network_security_config.xml -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false" />
</network-security-config>
<!-- only if one legacy host really needs HTTP: scope it to that host, never to base-config -->
<domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
    <domain includeSubdomains="false">legacy.example.com</domain>
</domain-config>
```

#### CWE-926 - Improper Export of Android Application Components

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="true" />
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="normal" />   <!-- any app can request it -->
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" />   <!-- writes are open -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="false" />
<!-- if another app must call it: android:permission="com.example.PERM" with protectionLevel="signature", and validate every extra -->
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="signature" />
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" android:writePermission="com.example.WRITE" />
```

#### CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = true
<provider android:exported="true" android:grantUriPermissions="true" ... />   <!-- every path can be handed out -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = false
webSettings.allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs = false
<provider android:exported="false" android:grantUriPermissions="false" ...>
    <grant-uri-permission android:pathPrefix="/shared/" />   <!-- only the paths that must be shared -->
</provider>
```

#### CWE-749 - Exposed Dangerous Method or Function

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Every page the WebView loads (including injected ads or a hijacked link) can call the exposed @JavascriptInterface methods, for example to read files, tokens or start activities.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webView.addJavascriptInterface(Bridge(this), "app")
webView.loadUrl(urlFromIntent)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// load only your own HTTPS origins and expose nothing else
if (Uri.parse(url).host == "app.example.com") webView.loadUrl(url)
// modern alternative with an origin allow-list: WebViewCompat.addWebMessageListener(webView, "app", setOf("https://app.example.com"), listener)
```

#### CWE-927 - Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: A broadcast or PendingIntent without an explicit target can be received or filled in by a malicious app that registered a matching filter.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.example.TOKEN").putExtra("token", t))
PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, 0)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
sendBroadcast(Intent("com.example.TOKEN").setPackage(packageName).putExtra("token", t))
PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE)
```

#### CWE-327 - Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO

Risk: DES/RC4/MD5/ECB-mode data can be decrypted or forged much faster than the key length suggests. ECB shows patterns (equal blocks give equal ciphertext) and has no integrity.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
Cipher.getInstance("AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding")
MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5")
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding")        // authenticated encryption
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key)                        // let the provider create a fresh random IV
val iv = cipher.iv; val ct = cipher.doFinal(plain)           // store iv next to ct
// hashing: SHA-256 or better; passwords: PBKDF2 / Argon2 / scrypt, never a plain hash
```

#### CWE-798 - Use of Hard-coded Credentials

OWASP: M1 Improper Credential Usage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-CRYPTO

Risk: Anyone can unzip the APK (or run strings on the dex) and read the key, token or password. A leaked cloud/API key lets the attacker call the backend as the app, run up the bill, or read other users' data. Removing it in the next release does not help: old APKs stay in the wild, so the key must be rotated. Resources are no hiding place: res/values/strings.xml is compiled into resources.arsc, and apktool or a plain unzip shows every string. Tokens (JWT) can be decoded by anyone, and a Google / Firebase API key is only safe when it is restricted to your app.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
const val API_KEY = "EXAMPLE_ONLY_NOT_A_REAL_KEY"   // shipped inside every APK
val client = Api(API_KEY)
<!-- res/values/strings.xml: this ends up readable inside resources.arsc -->
<string name="api_secret">EXAMPLE_ONLY_NOT_A_REAL_KEY</string>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// keep the secret on YOUR server; the app only holds a short-lived user token
val token = authRepository.sessionToken()      // issued after login, expires, revocable
val client = Api(token)
// if a client key is unavoidable: restrict it (package name + SHA-256 cert, API scope, quota) and rotate it
// Google / Firebase API key in strings.xml: in the Cloud console restrict it to Android apps (package name + SHA-1) and to the APIs you use
<!-- strings.xml keeps only public identifiers; secrets and long-lived tokens stay on your backend -->
```

#### CWE-328 - Use of Weak Hash

OWASP: M10 Insufficient Cryptography | MASVS: MASVS-CRYPTO

Risk: MD5 and SHA-1 collisions are practical, so signatures, integrity checks or password hashes built on them can be forged or cracked quickly.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-1").digest(data)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256").digest(data)
// passwords: use a slow KDF (PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 with 600000+ iterations, Argon2id, scrypt)
```

#### CWE-502 - Deserialization of Untrusted Data

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE

Risk: A crafted serialized object can instantiate unexpected classes while it is read (gadget chains) and lead to code execution, denial of service or tampered state.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val obj = ObjectInputStream(input).readObject()
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// use a data-only format with a schema (JSON / Protobuf) and validate every field
val dto = Json.decodeFromString<Message>(text)
// if Java serialization is unavoidable: set an ObjectInputFilter allow-list
```

#### CWE-295 - Improper Certificate Validation

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: On a shared Wi-Fi or a hostile network the attacker presents any certificate and the app accepts it, so passwords, tokens and API traffic can be read and changed (man-in-the-middle). In network_security_config.xml the same thing happens by configuration: a certificates entry with src=user (or overridePins=true) makes the app trust CAs that the user or malware installed, so a proxy such as Burp or mitmproxy can decrypt the traffic of a normal release build. Without a pin-set, any certificate signed by a trusted CA is accepted for your backend.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
object : X509TrustManager {
    override fun checkServerTrusted(c: Array<X509Certificate>, a: String) { }   // accepts everything
    override fun checkClientTrusted(c: Array<X509Certificate>, a: String) { }
    override fun getAcceptedIssuers() = arrayOf<X509Certificate>()
}
<!-- res/xml/network_security_config.xml: trusts any CA the user (or malware) installed -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config>
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="system" />
            <certificates src="user" />
        </trust-anchors>
    </base-config>
</network-security-config>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// use the platform trust store (do not override TrustManager at all)
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .certificatePinner(CertificatePinner.Builder()
        .add("api.example.com", "sha256/AAAA...=")      // optional: pin to your own backend
        .build())
    .build()
// WebView: in onReceivedSslError call handler.cancel(), never handler.proceed()

#### CWE-524 - Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="text" />   <!-- password-like field with suggestions on -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword|textNoSuggestions" android:importantForAutofill="no" />

#### CWE-1021 - Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames (Tapjacking)

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: A malicious app draws a transparent or misleading overlay on top of a login or payment screen; the user's taps go through to the real buttons or the overlay captures what is typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword" ... />   <!-- no filterTouchesWhenObscured -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<LinearLayout android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true" ...>
// or, API 31+: window.setHideOverlayWindows(true)  (needs HIDE_OVERLAY_WINDOWS)

#### CWE-73 - External Control of File Name or Path

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM / MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: A file:// or content:// URI chosen by the caller makes the app open its own private files (or another provider's data) and hand the bytes on.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri"); contentResolver.openInputStream(uri!!)
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val uri = intent.getParcelableExtra<Uri>("uri")

#### CWE-918 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

OWASP: M4 Insufficient Input/Output Validation | MASVS: MASVS-CODE / MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: When a deep link, Intent extra or web page decides which host the app connects to, an attacker can point it at an internal service, a server that logs the app's headers and tokens, or a cleartext endpoint.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
val url = intent.getStringExtra("endpoint")
val conn = URL(url).openConnection()      // host chosen by the caller
```

Secure:

```kotlin
val id = intent.getStringExtra("endpoint")
