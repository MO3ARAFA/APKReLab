# APK ReLab report: org.adaway

(sandbox scan, no AI triage)

## Security scan

Heuristic static scan - 82 finding(s) in total; 10 listed below (app/unknown code; INFO and known-library findings left out). Findings are leads: verify manually before relying on any of this.

Not covered by this scan: business-logic flaws (prices, limits, order flows), server-side bugs of the APIs the app calls, and native (C/C++) code; a large app is analysed in groups, so a data flow that crosses groups can be missed.

### Summary

| Severity | Count |
|---|---|
| MEDIUM | 3 |
| LOW | 7 |

**OWASP Mobile Top 10 (2024) coverage**

- M9 Insecure Data Storage: 3
- M8 Security Misconfiguration: 3
- M5 Insecure Communication: 3
- Not mapped: 1

### Findings

#### 1. [MEDIUM] Backup allowed (allowBackup)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-530 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-allow-backup
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: android:allowBackup is not explicitly "false" (it defaults to true). Via `adb backup` (no root needed on many OS versions) or a cloud backup, the app's private data - databases, SharedPreferences, saved tokens - can be extracted.
- Risk scenario: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.
- Fix: Set android:allowBackup="false", or if backups are wanted, add a dataExtractionRules/fullBackupContent file that explicitly excludes anything sensitive.

#### 2. [MEDIUM] Powerful permissions requested (1)

- Location: `AndroidManifest.xml`
- CWE: CWE-250 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: manifest-powerful-permissions
- Priority: 45/100 (P2)
- Why flagged: - REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES: can install other APKs
- Risk scenario: Extra privileges (debuggable, test-only, shared user id, legacy storage) widen what a compromise or a malicious app can reach. Powerful permissions (SMS, overlay, install packages) and an AccessibilityService give a compromised app, or overlay and banking malware, far more reach than the feature needs.
- Fix: Request only what the feature really needs, and prefer the narrower alternative (photo picker, SAF, SMS Retriever / User Consent API instead of READ_SMS).

#### 3. [LOW] HTTP client built without certificate pinning

- Location: `org.adaway.model.source.SourceModel`
- CWE: CWE-295 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: LOW | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: An OkHttpClient is built in this class with no CertificatePinner. A user-installed or rogue CA can then intercept the HTTPS traffic (this is what a proxy like Burp relies on).  (around line 682)
- Risk scenario: On a shared Wi-Fi or a hostile network the attacker presents any certificate and the app accepts it, so passwords, tokens and API traffic can be read and changed (man-in-the-middle). In network_security_config.xml the same thing happens by configuration: a certificates entry with src=user (or overridePins=true) makes the app trust CAs that the user or malware installed, so a proxy such as Burp or mitmproxy can decrypt the traffic of a normal release build. Without a pin-set, any certificate signed by a trusted CA is accepted for your backend.
- Fix: For traffic to your own backend add a CertificatePinner (or a <pin-set> in network_security_config.xml).

#### 4. [LOW] Dynamic receiver registered without export flag

- Location: `org.adaway.model.update.UpdateModel`
- CWE: CWE-926 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: receiver-export-flag | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: registerReceiver(receiver, filter) without RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED is reachable by other apps, which can then send it crafted broadcasts.  (around line 588)
- Risk scenario: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.
- Fix: Use registerReceiver(..., Context.RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED) (API 33+; ContextCompat on older) when only the app itself sends these broadcasts.

#### 5. [LOW] HTTP client built without certificate pinning

- Location: `org.adaway.model.update.UpdateModel`
- CWE: CWE-295 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: LOW | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: An OkHttpClient is built in this class with no CertificatePinner. A user-installed or rogue CA can then intercept the HTTPS traffic (this is what a proxy like Burp relies on).  (around line 71)
- Risk scenario: On a shared Wi-Fi or a hostile network the attacker presents any certificate and the app accepts it, so passwords, tokens and API traffic can be read and changed (man-in-the-middle). In network_security_config.xml the same thing happens by configuration: a certificates entry with src=user (or overridePins=true) makes the app trust CAs that the user or malware installed, so a proxy such as Burp or mitmproxy can decrypt the traffic of a normal release build. Without a pin-set, any certificate signed by a trusted CA is accepted for your backend.
- Fix: For traffic to your own backend add a CertificatePinner (or a <pin-set> in network_security_config.xml).

#### 6. [LOW] Data copied to clipboard

- Location: `org.adaway.util.Clipboard`
- CWE: CWE-200 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: androgoat-checks | Scope: APP
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The app puts data on the system clipboard. On many Android versions other apps can read the clipboard (and clipboard managers keep a history).  (around line 27)
- Risk scenario: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.
- Fix: Do not copy secrets to the clipboard; if you must, mark the clip sensitive (ClipDescription.EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE on API 33+) and clear it quickly.

#### 7. [LOW] Native libraries not analysed (5 .so)

- Location: `lib/`
- Confidence: HIGH | Rule: native-coverage
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: This APK contains native libraries (libc++_shared.so, libcrypto.so, libssl.so, libtcpdump_exec.so, libwebserver_exec.so). APKReLab analyses Java / Kotlin (dex) code only: data handed to native methods is not followed.
- Fix: Review the native code separately (e.g. strings / imports of the .so, a disassembler) and check what the app passes to its JNI methods.

#### 8. [LOW] Network Security Config: trusts user-installed CAs

- Location: `res/8G.xml`
- CWE: CWE-295 | OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK | Confidence: HIGH | Rule: res-nsc-user-ca
- Priority: 20/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The config trusts certificates the user installed in: domain-config localhost. A proxy such as Burp/mitmproxy (or malware that installs a CA) can then decrypt this app's HTTPS traffic (MASVS-NETWORK).  [res/8G.xml]
- Risk scenario: On a shared Wi-Fi or a hostile network the attacker presents any certificate and the app accepts it, so passwords, tokens and API traffic can be read and changed (man-in-the-middle). In network_security_config.xml the same thing happens by configuration: a certificates entry with src=user (or overridePins=true) makes the app trust CAs that the user or malware installed, so a proxy such as Burp or mitmproxy can decrypt the traffic of a normal release build. Without a pin-set, any certificate signed by a trusted CA is accepted for your backend.
- Fix: Trust only the system CAs (src="system") in release builds; keep user CAs inside <debug-overrides> only.

#### 9. [LOW] Keyboard cache: sensitive input field

- Location: `res/66.xml`
- CWE: CWE-524 | OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE | Confidence: LOW
- Priority: 12/100 (P4)
- Why flagged: The field "(id not resolved)" looks sensitive or is the main input of this screen, but its inputType (not set) does not disable suggestions. The keyboard may learn and cache what is typed (autocorrect dictionary, predictive text).  [res/66.xml]
- Risk scenario: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.
- Fix: Use android:inputType="textPassword" (or textNoSuggestions|textVisiblePassword) and consider importantForAutofill="no" for secrets.

#### 10. [MEDIUM] Password screen not protected against tapjacking (x4)

- Location: `res/ET.xml`
- CWE: CWE-1021 | OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM | Confidence: MEDIUM | Rule: tapjacking-sensitive-layout
- Priority: 38/100 (P3)
- Why flagged: This layout has a password field ("@0x7f0901d1") and no view in it sets android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true", so a malicious overlay can sit on top of the screen and the field still receives the taps (tapjacking). No code mitigation (setFilterTouchesWhenObscured, onFilterTouchEventForSecurity, setHideOverlayWindows) is referenced anywhere in the app's dex. minSdkVersion is 26: devices below Android 12 do not block touches through overlays.  [res/ET.xml]  The same applies to 3 more layout(s): res/Gh.xml, res/Y3.xml, res/gI.xml.
- Risk scenario: A malicious app draws a transparent or misleading overlay on top of a login or payment screen; the user's taps go through to the real buttons or the overlay captures what is typed.
- Fix: Set android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true" on the root of this layout (or call setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(true) on it / getWindow().setHideOverlayWindows(true) on API 31+ in the Activity).

### Remediation guide

One entry per weakness type found above.

#### CWE-530 - Exposure of Backup File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: With allowBackup=true, adb backup or a cloud restore can copy the app's private files (databases, preferences) off the device.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="true" ...>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<application android:allowBackup="false" android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules" ...>
<!-- or keep backup and exclude secrets with fullBackupContent / dataExtractionRules -->
```

#### CWE-250 - Execution with Unnecessary Privileges

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Extra privileges (debuggable, test-only, shared user id, legacy storage) widen what a compromise or a malicious app can reach. Powerful permissions (SMS, overlay, install packages) and an AccessibilityService give a compromised app, or overlay and banking malware, far more reach than the feature needs.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<application android:debuggable="true" android:testOnly="true" ...>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS" />
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<!-- ship release builds without debuggable / testOnly; request only the permissions you use -->
<!-- OTP codes: SMS Retriever or SMS User Consent API instead of READ_SMS; files: photo picker or the Storage Access Framework -->
```

#### CWE-295 - Improper Certificate Validation

OWASP: M5 Insecure Communication | MASVS: MASVS-NETWORK

Risk: On a shared Wi-Fi or a hostile network the attacker presents any certificate and the app accepts it, so passwords, tokens and API traffic can be read and changed (man-in-the-middle). In network_security_config.xml the same thing happens by configuration: a certificates entry with src=user (or overridePins=true) makes the app trust CAs that the user or malware installed, so a proxy such as Burp or mitmproxy can decrypt the traffic of a normal release build. Without a pin-set, any certificate signed by a trusted CA is accepted for your backend.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
object : X509TrustManager {
    override fun checkServerTrusted(c: Array<X509Certificate>, a: String) { }   // accepts everything
    override fun checkClientTrusted(c: Array<X509Certificate>, a: String) { }
    override fun getAcceptedIssuers() = arrayOf<X509Certificate>()
}
<!-- res/xml/network_security_config.xml: trusts any CA the user (or malware) installed -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config>
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="system" />
            <certificates src="user" />
        </trust-anchors>
    </base-config>
</network-security-config>
```

Secure:

```kotlin
// use the platform trust store (do not override TrustManager at all)
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .certificatePinner(CertificatePinner.Builder()
        .add("api.example.com", "sha256/AAAA...=")      // optional: pin to your own backend
        .build())
    .build()
// WebView: in onReceivedSslError call handler.cancel(), never handler.proceed()

<!-- network_security_config.xml: system CAs only in release; user CAs only for the debugging proxy -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config>
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="system" />
        </trust-anchors>
    </base-config>
    <debug-overrides>
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="user" />
        </trust-anchors>

#### CWE-926 - Improper Export of Android Application Components

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Any installed app can start an exported activity, send to an exported receiver or bind an exported service. Without a permission this exposes internal screens, actions or data (a broken access control). A permission with protectionLevel normal or dangerous does not help: any app can request it, only signature ties it to your signing key. A provider that protects only reads or only writes leaves the other direction open.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="true" />
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="normal" />   <!-- any app can request it -->
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" />   <!-- writes are open -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<activity android:name=".AdminActivity" android:exported="false" />
<!-- if another app must call it: android:permission="com.example.PERM" with protectionLevel="signature", and validate every extra -->
<permission android:name="com.example.PERM" android:protectionLevel="signature" />
<provider android:name=".Db" android:exported="true" android:readPermission="com.example.READ" android:writePermission="com.example.WRITE" />
```

#### CWE-200 - Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE / MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: Information reaches a party that should not see it (another app, a web page loaded in a WebView, a log, a backup). A provider with grantUriPermissions on the whole provider lets any Intent carrying one of its content:// URIs hand temporary access to every path.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = true
<provider android:exported="true" android:grantUriPermissions="true" ... />   <!-- every path can be handed out -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
webSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = false
webSettings.allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs = false
<provider android:exported="false" android:grantUriPermissions="false" ...>
    <grant-uri-permission android:pathPrefix="/shared/" />   <!-- only the paths that must be shared -->
</provider>
```

#### CWE-524 - Use of Cache Containing Sensitive Information

OWASP: M9 Insecure Data Storage | MASVS: MASVS-STORAGE

Risk: The keyboard dictionary, screenshots in the recents list, and caches can keep what the user typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="text" />   <!-- password-like field with suggestions on -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword|textNoSuggestions" android:importantForAutofill="no" />
```

#### CWE-1021 - Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames (Tapjacking)

OWASP: M8 Security Misconfiguration | MASVS: MASVS-PLATFORM

Risk: A malicious app draws a transparent or misleading overlay on top of a login or payment screen; the user's taps go through to the real buttons or the overlay captures what is typed.

Vulnerable:

```kotlin
<EditText android:inputType="textPassword" ... />   <!-- no filterTouchesWhenObscured -->
```

Secure:

```kotlin
<LinearLayout android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true" ...>
// or, API 31+: window.setHideOverlayWindows(true)  (needs HIDE_OVERLAY_WINDOWS)
```
